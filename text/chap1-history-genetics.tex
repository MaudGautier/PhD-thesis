\minitoc{}



Grand scientific discoveries sometimes lead a research field to completely reorganise around new principles or axioms. 
This was the case with the comprehension of heredity. 
Up until the late nineteenth century, the inheritance of acquired characters — the idea that an organism can transmit features that it has acquired through use or disuse during its lifetime to its progeny — was a supposedly well-established fact that had been accepted by a plethora of philosophers and scientists, starting with Hippocrates (c. 460--c. 370 BC) \citep{zirkle1935inheritance}.
However, Mendel's pioneering work on hybridisation questioned the latter paradigm and shaked the scientific community so well that it ended in the creation of a brand-new field in biology: genetics — which was first institutionalised in 1906 \citep{gayon2016mendel}.

In this chapter, I will review the main events of the genetics era that led to the concepts of recombination, gene conversion and genome evolution, which are of major interest for this thesis.
A reader who is not familiar with the vocable of recombination (such as ‘meiosis’, ‘gene conversion’, ‘post-meiotic segregation’, ‘interference’, etc…) may find this chapter slightly difficult, as these denominations will not be fully detailed here. I therefore send them back to the definitions at the beginning of this thesis, or to the subsequent chapters of this introduction where the terms will be fully described, whenever they come across one of them.

The historical developments that one can appreciate are nothing but the result of what was transmitted to us by our predecessors and I therefore entitled this chapter \textit{A geneticist's history of genetics} as a wink to what Richard Feynman (1918--1988), one of the most influential physicists of his time, wrote on this subject in his famous book on quantum physics \textit{\usebibentry{feynman2006qed}{title}} \citeyearpar{feynman2006qed}:

\begin{quote}
	\textit{‘By the way, what I have just outlined is what I call a “physicist’s history of physics,” which is never correct. What I am telling you is a sort of conventionalized myth-story that the physicists tell to their students, and those students tell to their students, and is not necessarily related to the actual historical development, which I do not really know!’}
\end{quote}






\section{Emergence of a concept: recombination}

\subsection{An abstruse exception to Mendel's laws of heredity}

Between 1857 and 1864, the Austrian monk Johann Gregor Mendel (1822--1884) undertook a series of hybridisation experiments on the garden pea plant \textit{Pisum sativum}. This led him to describe the idea of an ‘independent assortment of traits’ \citep{mendel1996experiments}, thereby proving the existence of paired ‘elementary units of heredity’ (i.e.\ genes) and establishing the statistical laws governing them.
His work remained unrecognised by the scientific community for several decades but was finally rediscovered in the early twentieth century when three botanists (Hugo de Vries (1848--1935), Carl Correns (1864--1933) and Erich von Tschermak (1871--1962)) independently confirmed his findings \citep{dunn2003gregor}.
Meanwhile, William Bateson (1861--1926) fiercely defended Mendel's thesis in \textit{\usebibentry{bateson1902mendel}{title}} \citep{bateson1902mendel} against his contemporary biometricians \citep[reviewed in][]{bateson2002william}, thus spreading Mendel's view into the scientific world.\\

A few years later, Bateson noticed exceptions to Mendel's principles of independent assortment: some crosses generated certain phenotypes in far excess from the expected Mendelian ratios \citep{bateson1905experimentalpea}. This led him and his collaborators to propose that certain traits were somehow coupled with one another, although they did not know how \citep{bateson1905experimental}. 







\subsection{The chromosomal theory of inheritance}

In the meantime, it had been understood that cells derived from other cells, but the exact process was unknown. 
To understand it, Walther Flemming (1843--1905) used stains to intensify the contrasts of cell contents observed through microscopy and identified a substance located within the nucleus, which he named ‘chromatin’ (from the Greek word \textit{\textgreek{χρῶμ}\textalpha}: ‘color’).
He described precisely the movements of chromosomes during cell division (which he termed ‘mitosis’), thus providing a mechanism for the distribution of nuclear material into daughter cells during mitosis \citep{flemming1879contributions}.

Theodor Boveri (1862--1915) went one step further by demonstrating the individuality of chromosomes in the roundworm \textit{Ascaris megalocephala}, which allowed him to suggest that the chromosomes of the germ cells are involved in heredity \citep{boveri1888zellen}.
In addition, he showed that the egg and the spermatozoon contribute the same number of chromosomes to the new individual, thus providing the first descriptions of meiosis \citep{boveri1890zellen}.
Walter Sutton (1877--1916) independently came to the same conclusion at about the same time: he enunciated the chromosomal theory of inheritance with the following words closing his \usebibentry{sutton1902morphology}{year} paper: ‘I may finally call attention to the probability that the association of paternal and maternal chromosomes in pairs and their subsequent separation during the reducing division […] may constitute the physical basis of the Mendelian law of heredity’ \citep{sutton1902morphology}.

However, this theory was debated in the scientific community, because there was yet no direct proof of a link between the inheritance of traits and the segregation of chromosomes.\\ 

In parallel, based on cytological observations of chromosomes, Frans Janssens (1863--1924), a priest also known as the ‘microscopy wizard’ for he mastered the process, developed the idea that the chromosomes' ‘filaments [chromatids] are involved in contacts that can modify their organisation from one segment to the next’ which ‘will generate new segmental combinations’ in his \textit{Chiasmatype Theory} \citep{janssens1909theorie}.



\subsection{Morgan's theory of gene linkage and crossing-over}

In 1909, Thomas Hunt Morgan (1856--1945) expressed his strong skepticism of the Mendelian theory of inheritance in his very derisive article \textit{\usebibentry{morgan1909factors}{title}} \citep{morgan1909factors} and doubted the chromosomal basis of heredity \citep[reviewed in][]{koszul2012centenary}.
Little did he know at the time that he was to become the main craftsman of the reconciliation of these two theories.\\

% \clearpage




In his famous ‘fly room’ where he bred \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} fruit flies, he found an unusual male white-eyed individual. Crossing it with purebred red-eyed females yielded red-eyed male and female F1 hybrids, — a typical result proving that the white eye color is a recessive trait. Unexpectedly, after inbreeding the heterozygous F1 progeny, he discovered that the traits of the F2 offspring did not assort independently: all white-eyed flies were males (Figure~\ref{fig:morgan-drosophila-cross-results}, left). 
However, when he crossed the white-eyed male with F1 daughters, he found both male and female white-eyed flies (Figure~\ref{fig:morgan-drosophila-cross-results}, right), thus showing that the white eye color was not lethal for females.

He immediately hypothesised that eye color was connected to the sex determinant \citep{morgan1910sex} and, as these findings were consistent with the idea that genes were physical objects located on chromosomes, Morgan soon came up with the idea of genetic linkage, i.e.\ the fact that two genes closely associated on a chromosome do not assort independently \citep{morgan1911random}. 
He also suggested that this coupling dependended on the distance between genes: ‘we find coupling in certain characters, and little or no evidence at all of coupling in other characters; the difference depending on the linear distance apart of the chromosomal material that represent the factors.’\\

With three of his students (Alfred Sturtevant (1891--1970), Hermann Muller (1890--1967) and Calvin Bridges (1889--1938)), he summarised all the evidence in \textit{\usebibentry{morgan1915mechanism}{title}} which constitutes one of the most important books in the whole history of genetics \citep{gayon2016mendel}.
There were two major propositions in that book. 

First, the recognition that Mendelian factors — Morgan would soon call them ‘genes’ — are physical portions of chromosomes. This brought a mechanistic support to Mendel's ‘law of segregation’ (according to which the zygote inherits only one version of each gene from each parent) and to the so far unexplained exception to Mendel's ‘law of independent assortment fo traits’: when two genes are located on the same chromosome, they have to segregate together — and thus the law does not apply to this special case. 

Second, they proposed that the linkage between genes located on the same chromosome could sometimes break, through the process of what Morgan called ‘crossing-over’ (Figure~\ref{fig:morgan-CO}). This was to take place at the positions of the chiasmata previously observed by Janssens \citep{janssens1909theorie}. Later, Edgar Wilson (1908--1992) and Morgan crafted structures of crossing-overs with clay to materialise how the crossing-over could physically form \citep{wilson1920chiasmatype}.\\

Altogether, with the ideas of recombination and crossing-over, Morgan had fused three theories: gene linkage (the major exception to Mendel's laws of heredity), the chromosomal theory of inheritance and the chiasmatype theory. This triggered a real revolution in biology and marked the commencement of genetics. His major contribution through his work on \textit{Drosophila} won him the \textit{Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine} in 1933.

It was only ten years later that Harriet Creighton (1909--2004) and Barbara McClintock (1902--1992) would bring the first proof of that theory by correlating cytological and genetic exchanges in maize \citep{creighton1931correlation}.

\section{Emergence of a concept: gene conversion}

\subsection{The study of fungal products of meiosis}


% Why fungi
The next major advances on the comprehension of the recombination mechanism were to come through the study of fungi, soon adopted as model organisms for the multiple advantages they confer to genetics reseach.
First, as they take up little space and are easy and cheap to propagate, they can be studied in very large numbers.

Second, it was reported early that they alternate haploid\footnote{Single set of chromosomes} and diploid\footnote{Two sets of chromosomes} phases. 
Indeed, the Czech scientist Jan \u{S}atava (1878--1938) managed to isolate the ascospores\footnote{Reproductive cells of a certain class of fungi (ascomycetes)} of a yeast and saw that they germinated without fusing other ascopores, thus giving rise to haploid cultures \citep[\cite{satava1918pohlavn}, reviewed in][]{barnett2007history}.
This feature, — haploidy of the progeny, — considerably facilitates the interpretation of the products of meiosis since the phenotype of each offspring is a direct manifestation of its genotype (contrary to diploid or higher-order of ploidy cases for which dominance and recessiveness may blur gene expression).

Third, in some fungi, the cells corresponding to the four products of meiosis remain grouped in a tetrad of four sexual spores, which makes the direct observation of a single meiosis possible.
The first study of this type, — a ‘tetrad analysis’, — was achieved by {{\O}}jvind Winge (1886--1964), the founder of yeast genetics \citep{winge1937two}.
In some ascomycetes, the meiotic products undergo one additional mitotic division, thus ending in ‘octads’ of four pairs of identical spores (Figure~\ref{fig:spores-formation}). 

Last, in certain fungi, the spindles of the meiotic (and mitotic, if applicable) divisions are constrained in a tube-shaped ascus preventing them from overlapping, which leads the tetrads (or octads) to arrange linearly, and makes the interpretation of the behaviour of genes during meiosis (and mitosis) straightforward (Figure~\ref{fig:spores-formation}) \citep{casselton2002art}.

		\par During the first meiotic segregation (Meiosis I), the homologous chromosomes either segregate with the occurrence of a crossing-over (right) or not (left).
		In absence of a crossing-over, the markers segregate at different nuclei at the end of first meiotic division and this results in ascopores displaying a sequence of four times the paternal allele and four times the maternal allele.
		In presence of a crossing-over, the markers segregate at different nuclei only at the end of the second meiotic division, which thus results in ascospores displaying an alternance of two times the paternal allele and two times the maternal allele.

\end{figure}


All these attributes and technical achievements rendered fungi superior model organisms for the study of recombination. And there began the dawn of the fungal genetics era.







\subsection{Four novel phenomena associated to recombination}

% Conversion genique
\subsubsection{Gene conversion}

Using them, Hans Winkler (1877--1945) observed 3+:1- and 1+:3- departures from the expected Mendelian segragation among tetrads of +/- diploids \citep[\cite{winkler1930konversion}, reviewed in][]{roman1985gene}, which meant that the information present on one chromatid was replaced by that from another chromatid \citep{orr1985fungal}.

This observation was later confirmed by Carl Lindegren (1896--1987), a former student of Morgan's, who obtained similar irregular ratios with frequencies of about 1\% in the budding yeast \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} \citep{lindegren1953gene} as well as by Mary Mitchell (fl. 1950--1965) who found 2:6 segregations\footnote{A 2:6 segregation in the eight-spored \textit{Neurospora} ascus is equivalent to a 1:3 segregation in the four-spored ascus of the budding yeast \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}.} of wild-type:recessive phenotypes in \textit{Neurospora} \citep{mitchell1955aberrant, mitchell1955further}.\\

Originally, Winkler had hypothesised that a mutational mechanism was at the origin of this replacement and invented the term ‘gene conversion’ to describe it. Although his interpretation turned out to be wrong (the mechanism is in fact purely recombinational, not mutational) and some authors suggested alternative nomenclature for it \citep[e.g.][]{roman1986early}, the term he had come up with persisted over the years and is still used today.

	}
\label{fig:olive-octads}
\end{figure}




% PMS
\subsubsection{Post-meiotic segregation}

Soon after, Lindsay Olive (1917--1988) observed another type of aberrant segregation in the octads of \textit{Sordaria fimicola}: 5:3 segregation ratios (Figure~\ref{fig:sub-olive-5to3}) \citep{olive1959aberrant, kitani1962genetics}.
This result was puzzling, since it was not congruent with the models so far: 6:2 segregations were explainable on the basis of a non-directional transfer of information from one chromatid to another one, but this sole explanation could not account for the 5:3 segregation ratios. 
However, these results were totally reconciliable with the concept of a chromatid composed of two functional subunits, which had been proposed after autoradiographic studies on DNA \citep{taylor1957organization} in accordance with the Watson-Crick model of DNA \citep{watson1953molecular}.

This feature was again observed in \textit{Neurospora crassa} concomitantly with the finding that several alleles were converted concertedly \citep{case1964allelic}. 
Such co-conversion of alleles was also found in \textit{S. cerevisiae}, together with the finding that the frequency of co-conversion decreases with increasing distance between the alleles \citep[\cite{fogel1969informational}, reviewed in][]{orr1985fungal}.\\


Altogether, these findings indicated the presence of ‘heteroduplex DNA’, i.e.\ a DNA portion where the two strands composing it contain different information for the segregating marker.
Such heteroduplex DNA cannot be detected genetically until an additional round of DNA replication produces two duplexes, each expressing the information from one of the strands of the heteroduplex.
These segregations, occuring after the end of meiosis, are called ‘post-meiotic segregations’ (PMS).
The additional observation that markers are co-converted at frequencies dependent on their distance suggested that heteroduplex DNA (and thus, gene conversion) could span hundreds of nucleotides \citep{orr1985fungal}.





% Conversion polarity
\subsubsection{Conversion polarity}

In addition, it was found that gene conversion frequencies vary linearly from one end of a gene to the other \citep[reviewed in][]{nicolas1994polarity}: this discovery was made in both \textit{Ascobolus immeraus} \citep{lissouba1960existence,lissouba1962fine} and in \textit{Neurospora crassa} \citep{murray1960complementation} at approximately the same time. 
This phenomenon was observed again in \textit{Aspergillus nidulans} \citep{siddiqi1962mutagenic} and in other mutants of \textit{Neurospora} \citep{stadler1963recombination}, and was designated as ‘conversion polarity’ or ‘polarised recombination’.

Later, one of its discoverers, Lady Noreen Murray (1935--2011) demonstrated that this polarity was due to elements located close to the gene, as opposed to being imposed by the orientation of the gene with respect to the centromere \citep{murray1968polarized}. This led to the idea that recombination initiates on ‘pseudofixed sites’, the erstwhile concept for what we now call ‘recombination hotspots’.





% Negative interference
\subsubsection{Interference}

One last important observation made during this decade came from a study on \textit{Aspergillus nidulans} \citep{pritchard1955linear}.
The authors looked at four linked marker genes, whose recessive alleles will here be designated as ‘y’, ‘11’, ‘8’ and ‘bi’, and whose dominant alleles will here be designated as ‘+’ in all four cases. 
They crossed a strain of genotype (y+8+) with a strain of genotype (+11+bi) to obtain a F1 hybrid of genotype ($\frac{y}{+}\frac{+}{11}\frac{8}{+}\frac{+}{bi}$) and found that the largest proportion of recombinants from this hybrid was of genotype (y++11), while all other combinations ((y+++), (+++bi) and (++++)) were under-represented \citep[reviewed in][]{whitehouse1965crossing}.
Similar observations of this phenomenon were made in \textit{Neurospora crassa} \citep{mitchell1956consideration}.

These findings suggested that recombination between alleles (in this case, between the second and third marker) are negatively associated with recombination in neighbouring regions (in this case, between the first and second, and between the third and fourth markers). This feature was designated as ‘interference’.







\subsection{The first theories on the recombinational mechanism}

% CONCLUSION: lien et tehories qui vont suivre.
To sum up, over the course of the 1950's and of the early 1960's, numerous studies evidenced that crossing-over was associated with gene conversion, PMS, polarised recombination and interference.

It was soon proposed that all these processes were somehow mechanistically linked \citep{perkins1962frequency} and from that point on, several scientists conjectured theories reuniting these observations.
One important one, the ‘copy-choice hypothesis’, was postulated by Joshua Lederberg (1925--2008) \citep{lederberg1955recombination}. According to this (wrong) theory, the process of replication switches from copying one parental chromosome to the other — the switch occuring when both chromosomes are closely paired.
An alternative hypothesis, ‘the hybrid DNA hypothesis’, was proposed \citep{whitehouse1963theory}, allegedly inspired from the model of Robin Holliday (1932--2014) \citep{holliday2011recombination} which the latter would publish the following year \citep{holliday1964mechanism}.

The Holliday model \citep{holliday1964mechanism,holliday1968genetic}, which was in accordance with the then recent discovery of the double-stranded structure of DNA \citep{franklin1953molecular,watson1953molecular,wilkins1953molecular}, happened to be the first widely accepted molecular explanation for the phenomena with which crossing-over had been found to be associated, namely aberrant segregation (i.e.\ gene conversion and PMS) and polarised recombination. 
Briefly, this model rested on the formation of two concomitant DNA breaks, the separation of the two DNA strands followed by base pairing between the complementary segments to form symmetric heteroduplex DNA and the so-called ‘Holliday junction’, and last, the resolution of this junction by cutting either the originally crossed or the non-crossed strands.

Over the following two decades, the Holliday model was meticulously tested and revised \citep[reviewed in][]{haber2008evolution} and several other models were formulated to account for novel experimental observations.
Notably, Matthew Meselson (born 1930) and Charles Radding (born 1946) proposed one according to which a Holliday structure would be generated by a single-strand nick in only one chromosome \citep{meselson1975general}.
A few years later, their model was supplanted by one that is still used today: the double-strand break repair (DSBR) model \citep{szostak1983doublestrandbreak}.
According to the latter, recombination is initiated by a DNA double-strand break (DSB) on one chromosome and the resulting strand exchange leads to the formation of a double-Holliday junction (dHJ).
This model, as well as all the other recombinational models used today, will be detailed in Chapter~\ref{ch:2-recombination-mechanistics}.\\

In addition to all these advances on the mechanistical aspects of heredity, the early twentieth century was marked by theoretical breakthroughs in the study of evolution, which I review in the upcoming section.




\section{Emergence of a concept: genome evolution}

\subsection{The dawn of population genetics}

Soon after the rediscovery of Mendel's laws of inheritance, a fierce debate opposed two groups of biologists: Mendelians who believed that evolution was driven by mutations transmitted by the discrete segregation of alleles \citep{bowler2003evolution}, and biometricians who claimed that variation was continuous.
The first group, led by Bateson and de Vries, maintained that the variations measured by biometricians were too small to account for evolution while the second, led by Karl Pearson (1857--1936) and Walter Weldon (1860--1906), rejected Mendelian genetics on the basis that it would necessarily imply discontinuous evolutionary leaps \citep{provine2001origins}.

It was only fifteen years later that the British statistician Ronald A.\ Fisher (1890--1962) reconciled both theories, first by proving mathematically that mutiple discrete loci could result in a continuous variation \citep{fisher1919xv} and then by showing in subsequent papers and in his book \textit{\usebibentry{fisher1930genetical}{title}} \citeyearpar{fisher1930genetical} that natural selection could change allele frequencies in a population and result in evolution.
Soon after, in a series of ten papers named \textit{\usebibentry{haldane1927mathematical}{title}} \citeyearpar{haldane1927mathematical}, another British geneticist — John B.\ S.\ Haldane (1892--1964) — derived equations of allele frequency change at a single locus under a broad range of conditions.
This allowed him to re-establish natural selection as the major cause of evolution \citep{haldane1932causes}.
The contributions of the two of them, — together with that of Sewall Wright (1889--1988), a geneticist living across the Atlantic who worked out the mathematics for combinations of interacting genes, — laid the foundations for population genetics, a discipline which basically integrated Mendelism, Darwinism and biometry.

The emergence of this new field of study was the first step towards the development of a unified theory of evolution named the ‘modern synthesis’ \citep{huxley1942evolution}. 
Its founders — Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900--1975), George Ledyard Stebbins Jr.\ (1906--2000) and Ernst Mayr (1904--2005) — all defined it on the basis of natural selection acting on the heritable variation supplied by mutations \citep{mayr1959where,stebbins1966processes,dobzhansky1974chance}.
But the exclusive contribution of this adaptive process to genome evolution was soon to be contested.

\subsection{Neutralists \textit{versus} selectionists: a conflictual story}

One of Wright's main contributions to population genetics was the introduction of the concept of ‘adaptive landscapes’ according to which phenomena other than natural selection, — like genetic drift and inbreeding, — could push small populations away from adaptive peaks, thus propelling, in turn, natural selection to drive them towards different adaptive peaks \citep{wright1932roles}.
As such, the relative contributions of neutral forces (like genetic drift) and adaptive forces (like natural selection) became a major subject of debate between Wright and Fisher \citep{plutynski2007drift}.

But this controversy really intensified after Motoo Kimura (1924--1994) proposed the neutral theory of molecular evolution \citep{kimura1968evolutionary,kimura1991neutral,kimura1986dna} and Tomoko Ohta (born 1933) adapted it as the nearly neutral theory \citep{ohta1973slightly}.
For selectionists, most mutations are either beneficial or harmful and are thus either retained or purged by the action of natural selection, whereas supporters of the neutral theory claim that most mutations are adaptively neutral and thus become fixed in populations through the cumulative effect of sampling drift \citep{lewin1996patterns}.

As of today, it is widely accepted that both genetic drift and natural selection participate in the evolution of genomes: the controversy is no longer strictly dichotomous but rather concerns the quantitative contributions of adaptive and of non-adaptive evolutionary processes.
Though, distinguishing between both types of processes may not be that simple, for selection also has important indirect effects directly due to the process of recombination, as detailed in the next subsection.



\subsection{Recombination in the context of genome evolution}

At approximately the same time, scientists suggested that other evolutionary processes may be linked to recombination \citep{maynardsmith1974hitchhiking}: theoretically, a gene undergoing a selective sweep could result in allele frequency changes of the loci in its vicinity, thus resulting in a local decrease of polymorphism.
This phenomenon — later known as genetic hitchhiking or background selection depending on the direction of selection — was then empirically demonstrated by \citet{begun1992levels} when they put to light an apparent correlation between the level of genetic diversity and the recombination rate in flies.

As such, it became obvious that recombination plays a major role in genome evolution and that it should, in no case, be overlooked.
But, to understand precisely the extent of its contribution to evolution, it is necessary to know more about its mechanistics: this will be reviewed in the following chapter.
