\paragraph{An unexplained exception to Mendel's laws of heredity.}
Between 1857 and 1864, the Austrian monk Gregor Mendel (1822--1884) undertook a series of hybridisation experiments on the garden pea plant \textit{Pisum sativum}. This led him to describe the idea of an “independent assortment of traits” \citep{mendel1996experiments}, thereby proving the existence of paired “elementary units of heredity” (i.e.\ genes) and establishing the statistical laws governing them.
His work remained unrecognised by the scientific community for several decades but was finally rediscovered in the early twentieth century when three botanists (Hugo de Vries (1845--1935), Carl Correns (1864--1963) and Erich von Tschermak (1871--1962)) independently confirmed his findings \citep{dunn2003gregor}.
Meanwhile, William Bateson (1861--1926) fiercely defended Mendel's thesis in \textit{\usebibentry{bateson1902mendel}{title}} \citep{bateson1902mendel} against his contemporary biometricians \citep[reviewed in][]{bateson2002william}, thus spreading Mendel's view into the scientific world.\\
% Meanwhile, as Mendel's attempts to explain the mechanisms of heredity lacked scientific support and contradicted Galton's “Law of Ancestral Heredity”, many scientists were skeptiks

A few years later, Bateson noticed exceptions to Mendel's principles of independent assortment: some crosses generated certain phenotypes in far excess from the expected Mendelian ratios \citep{bateson1905experimentalpea}. This led him and his collaborators to propose that certain traits were somehow coupled with one another, although they did not know how \citep{bateson1905experimental}. 
%They had discovered what is now called “genetic linkage”.

\paragraph{The chromosomal theory of inheritance.}
In the meantime, it had been understood that cells derived from other cells, but the exact process was unknown. 
To understand it, Walther Flemming (1843--1905) used stains to intensify the contrasts of cell contents observed through microscopy and identified a substance located within the nucleus, which he named “chromatin” (from the greek word \textit{\textchi\textrho\textomega\textmu\textalpha}: “color”).
He described precisely the movements of chromosomes during cell division (which he termed “mitosis”), thus providing a mechanism for the distribution of nuclear material into daughter cells during mitosis \citep{flemming1879contributions}.

Theodor Boveri (1862--1915) went one step further by demonstrating the individuality of chromosomes in the roundworm \textit{Ascaris megalocephala}, which allowed him to suggest that the chromosomes of the germ cells are involved in heredity \citep{boveri1888zellen}.
In addition, he showed that the egg and the spermatozoon contribute the same number of chromosomes to the new individual, thus providing the first descriptions of meiosis \citep{boveri1890zellen}.
Walter Sutton (1877--1916) independently came to the same conclusion at about the same time: he enunciated the chromosomal theory of inheritance with the following words closing his \usebibentry{sutton1902morphology}{year} paper: “I may finally call attention to the probability that the association of paternal and maternal chromosomes in pairs and their subsequent separation during the reducing division […] may constitute the physical basis of the Mendelian law of heredity” \citep{sutton1902morphology}.

However, this theory was debated in the scientific community, because there was yet no direct proof of a link between the inheritance of traits and the segregation of chromosomes.\\ 

In parallel, based on cytological observations of chromosomes, Frans Janssens (1863--1924), a priest also known as the “microscopy wizard” for he mastered the process, developed the idea that the chromosomes' “filaments [chromatids] are involved in contacts that can modify their organization from one segment to the next” which “will generate new segmental combinations” in his \textit{Chiasmatype Theory} \citep{janssens1909theorie}.



\paragraph{Thomas Hunt Morgan's theory of gene linkage and crossing-over.}
% Morgan ne croit à aucune des theories. Pourtant, va etre le lien de ces trois. 
% Morgan decouvre une mutation chez la droso (explication globale dessus) => suspecte la liaison.
% Il decrit le mecansisme dans livre 1915.
% 
In 1909, Thomas Hunt Morgan (1856--1945) expressed his strong skepticism of the Mendelian theory of inheritance in his very derisive article \textit{\usebibentry{morgan1909factors}{title}} \citep{morgan1909factors} and doubted the chromosomal basis of heredity \citep[reviewed in][]{koszul2012centenary}.
Little did he know at the time that he was to become the main craftsman of the reconciliation of these two theories.\\

In his famous “fly room” where he bred \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} fruit flies, he found an unusual male white-eyed individual. Crossing it with purebred red-eyed females yielded red-eyed males and females F1 hybrids, — a typical result proving that the white eye color is a recessive trait. Unexpectedly, after inbreeding the heterozygous F1 progeny, he discovered that the traits of the F2 offspring did not assort independently: all white-eyed flies were males (Figure~\ref{fig:morgan-drosophila-cross-results}, left). 
However, when he crossed the white-eyed male with F1 daughters, he found both male and female white-eyed flies (Figure~\ref{fig:morgan-drosophila-cross-results}, right), thus showing that the white eye color was not lethal for females.

He immediately hypothesised that eye color was connected to the sex determinant \citep{morgan1910sex} and, as these findings were consistent with the idea that genes were physical objects located on chromosomes, Morgan soon came up with the idea of genetic linkage, i.e.\ the fact that two genes closely associated on a chromosome do not assort independently \citep{morgan1911random}. 
He also suggested that this coupling dependended on the distance between genes: “we find coupling in certain characters, and little or no evidence at all of coupling in other characters; the difference depending on the linear distance apart of the chromosomal material that represent the factors.”

With three of his students (Alfred Sturtevant (1891--1970), Hermann Muller (1890--1967) and Calvin Bridges (1889--1938)), he summarized all the evidence in \textit{\usebibentry{morgan1915mechanism}{title}} which constitutes one of the most important books in the whole history of genetics \citep{gayon2016mendel}.
aThere were two major propositions in that book. 
First, the recognition that Mendelian factors — Morgan would soon call them “genes” — are physical portions of chromosomes. This brought a mechanistic support to Mendel's “law of segregation” (according to which the zygote inherits only one version of each gene from each parent) and to the so far unexplained exception to Mendel's “law of independent assortment fo traits”: when two genes are located on the same chromosome, they have to segregate together — and thus the law does not apply to this special case. 
Second, they proposed that the linkage between genes located on the same chromosome could sometimes break, through the process of what Morgan called ”crossing-over” (Figure~\ref{fig:morgan-CO}). This was to take place at the positions of the chiasmata previously observed by Janssens \citep{janssens1909theorie}. Later, Edgar Wilson (1908--1992) and Morgan crafted structures of crossing-overs with clay to materialise how the crossing-over could physically form \citep{wilson1920chiasmatype}.\\

Altogether, with the ideas of recombination and crossing-over, Morgan had fused three theories: gene linkage (the major exception to Mendel's laws of heredity), the chromosomal theory of inheritance and the chiasmatype theory. This triggered a real revolution in biology and marked the commencement of genetics. His major contribution through his work on \textit{Drosophila} won him the \textit{Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine} in 1933.

It was only ten years later that Harriet Creighton (1909--2004) and Barbara McClintock (1902--1992) would bring the first proof of that theory by correlating cytological and genetic exchanges in maize \citep{creighton1931correlation}.

\paragraph{The discovery of gene conversion through the analysis of fungal products of meiosis.}


% Why fungi
The next major advances on the comprehension of the recombination mechanism were to come through the study of fungi, soon adopted as model organisms for the multiple advantages they confer to genetics reseach.
First, as they take up little space and are easy and cheap to propagate, they can be studied in very large numbers.
% Second, it was reported early that they alternate haploid and diploid phases, i.e.\ phases with respectively one and two sets of chromosomes.

Second, it was reported early that they alternate haploid\footnote{Single set of chromosomes} and diploid\footnote{Two sets of chromosomes} phases. 
Indeed, the Czech scientist Jan \u{S}atava (1878--1938) managed to isolate the ascospores\footnote{Reproductive cells of a certain class of fungi (ascomycetes)} of a yeast and saw that they germinated without fusing other ascopores, thus giving rise to haploid cultures \citep[\cite{satava1918pohlavn}, reviewed by][]{barnett2007history}.
This characteristic — haploidy of the progeny — considerably facilitates the interpretation of the products of meiosis since the phenotype of each offspring is a direct manifestation of its genotype (contrary to diploid or higher-order of ploidy cases for which dominance and recessiveness may blur gene expression).

Third, in some fungi, the cells corresponding to the four products of meiosis remain grouped in a tetrad of four sexual spores, which makes the direct observation of a single meiosis possible.
The first study of this type — a “tetrad analysis” — was achieved by {{\O}}jvind Winge (1886--1964), the founder of yeast genetics \citep{winge1937two}.
In some ascomycetes, the meiotic products undergo one additional mitotic division, thus ending in “octads” of four pairs of identical spores (Figure~\ref{fig:spores-formation}). 

Last, in certain fungi, the spindles of the meiotic (and mitotic, if applicable) divisions are constrained in a tube-shaped ascus preventing them from overlapping, which leads the tetrads (or octads) to arrange linearly (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:neurospora-spores}), and makes the interpretation of the behaviour of genes during meiosis (and mitosis) straightforward (Figure~\ref{fig:spores-formation}) \citep{casselton2002art}.

These attributes rendered fungi superior model organisms for the study of recombination, hence the dawn of the fungal genetics era.\\

% Conversion genique

Using them, Hans Winkler (1877--1945) observed 3+:1- and 1-:3+ departures from the expected Mendelian segragation among tetrads of +/- diploids and invented the term “gene conversion” to describe such events \citep[\cite{winkler1930konversion}, reviewed by][]{roman1985gene}. 
This observation was later confirmed by Carl Lindegren (1896--1987), a former student of Morgan's, who obtained similar irregular ratios with frequencies of about 1\% in the budding yeast \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} \citep{lindegren1953gene} as well as by Mary Mitchell (fl. 1950--1965) who found 2:6 segregations\footnote{A 2:6 segregation in the eight-spored \textit{Neurospora} ascus is equivalent to a 1:3 segregation in the four-spored ascus of yeast.} of wild-type:recessive phenotypes in \textit{Neurospora} \citep{mitchell1955aberrant, mitchell1955further}. 
Such observation means that the information present on one chromatid is replaced by that of another chromatid \citep{orr1985fungal}.
Since Winkler originally wrongly described gene conversion as a mutational mechanism (instead of a recombinational one), some authors suggested other nomenclature \citep[e.g.][]{roman1986early}, but his term persisted over the years, even though the idea turned to a pure recombinational mechanism.\\

\end{figure}


% PMS
Soon after, Lindsay Olive (1917--1988) observed another type of aberrant segregation in the octads of \textit{Sordaria firmicola}: 5:3 segregation ratios (Figure~\ref{fig:sub-olive-5to3}) \citep{olive1959aberrant, kitani1962genetics}.
This result was puzzling, since it was not congruent with the models so far: 6:2 segregations were explainable on the basis of a non-directiional transfer of information from one chromatid to another one, but this sole explanation could not account for the 5:3 segregation ratios. 
However, these results were totally reconciliable with the concept of a chromatid being composed by two functional subunits, which was proposed after autoradiographic studies on DNA \citep{taylor1957organization} in accordance with the Watson-Crick model of DNA \citep{watson1953molecular}.

At the same time, co-conversion of several alleles in addition to post-meiotic segregation\footnote{Segregation occuring after the end of meiosis, during the mitotic division (Figure~\ref{fig:spores-formation})} of the sites was observed in \textit{Neurospora crassa} \citep{case1964allelic}. Co-conversion of alleles was later found again in \textit{S. cerevisiae}, in addition to the finding that the frequency of co-conversion decreases with increasing distance between the alleles \citep[\cite{fogel1969informational}, reviewed by][]{orr1985fungal}. 

Altogether, these findings indicated the presence of what was called “heteroduplex DNA”, i.e.\ a DNA portion where the two strands composing it contain different information for the segregating marker.
Such heteroduplex DNA cannot be detected genetically until an additional round of DNA replication produces two duplexes, each expresing the information from one of the strands of the heteroduplex.
These segregations, occuring after the end of meiosis, are called “post-meiotic segregations” (PMS).
The additional observation that markers are co-converted at frequencies dependent on their distance suggested that heteroduplex DNA (and thus, gene conversion) could span hundreds of nucleotides long \citep{orr1985fungal}.

Donc, au final, on comprend que ces mecanismes sont correles (gene conversion et PMS) et qu'il existe des sites d'initiation de la recombinaison.

At the time, gene conversion was well established but not understood. Ten years passed before Robin Holliday (1932--2014) would translate this phenomenon into a satisfactory mechanism \citep{holliday1964mechanism}, based on the novel discovery of the double-stranded structure of DNA \citep{franklin1953molecular,watson1953molecular}.

PLAN\:

Gene conversion, other exception to Mendel's segregation: local nonreciprocal transfer of genetic information (Winkler 1930; Lindergren 1953; Mitchell 1955)

postmeiotic segregation (PMS) indicated the presence of heteroduplex DNA (Olive 1959; Kitani et al. 1962)

polarity gradients of gene conversion lead to the idea that recombination initiated from pseudofixed sites (Lissouba and Rizet 1960; Murray 1960)

strong correlation between gene conversion/PMS events and crossing-over led to the proposal that these processes were mechanistically linked (Kitani et al. 1962; Perkins 1962; Whitehouse 1963)








four key concepts that formed the foundation of molecular models of recombination:gene conversion, an exception to Mendel’s principle of segregation, signaled a local nonreciprocal transfer of genetic information (Winkler 1930; Lindergren 1953; Mitchell 1955); postmeiotic segregation (PMS) indicated the presence of heteroduplex DNA (Olive 1959; Kitani et al. 1962); polarity gradients of gene conversion lead to the idea that recombination initiated from pseudofixed sites (Lissouba and Rizet 1960; Murray 1960); and the strong correlation between gene conversion/PMS events and crossing-over led to the proposal that these processes were mechanistically linked (Kitani et al. 1962; Perkins 1962; Whitehouse 1963).
