\section*{Preamble: The roots of research on recombination}
Mendel (Monk) 

% Meiosis was discovered and described for the first time in sea urchin eggs in 1876 by the German biologist Oscar Hertwig. It was described again in 1883, at the level of chromosomes, by the Belgian zoologist Edouard Van Beneden, in Ascaris worms' eggs. The significance of meiosis for reproduction and inheritance, however, was described only in 1890 by German biologist August Weismann, who noted that two cell divisions were necessary to transform one diploid cell into four haploid cells if the number of chromosomes had to be maintained. In 1911 the American geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan observed crossover in Drosophila melanogaster meiosis and provided the first genetic evidence that genes are transmitted on chromosomes.
% The term meiosis was first used by J.B. Farmer and J.B. Moore in 1905.[citation needed] It is derived from Greek word (μείωσις), meaning "lessening".

\section*{Sorte de plan / Liste d'idees}
historic
initiation of recombination: 
- Homologue pairing / interhomolg interactions
- determinsation localisation
- formation DSB / programmed DSB formation
Meiotic DSB repair:
- Homoology search
- synapsis between homologues
- models of recombination
- Resolution into CO/NCO
- Dissolution of the SC
Crossover control: 
- assurance / interference
- differentiation CO/NCO
Chromatin state: shapes the recombination landscape (ou dans position des hotspots): nucleosome occupancy + meiotic chromosome architecture. 
Importance of meiotic recombination: Genetic disorders otherwise + exemple de l'un qui a perdu PRDM9 mais qui n'est pas stérile pour autant. 
Checkpoints
strand asymmetry
DNA polymerases
Gene conversion ici? + non-allelic gene conversion (et un impact sur la détection de)



Deuxieme chapitre:
Methodological approaches to study recombination
Variation of recombination rates wtithin genomes and among species
evolvability of recombination rates
