\end{quote}

This is how the fanciful Bill Hamilton (1936—2000) sums up the mystery of sexual reproduction (or simply, “sex”) that has been puzzling biologists for over a century and which, to this day, remains unanswered \citep{de2007evolution, otto2009evolutionary}.

This so-called “paradox of sex” finds its roots in that most theoretical arguments plead an elevated cost of sex as compared to asexual modes of reproduction \citep{otto2002evolution,lehtonen2012many}.
First, females invest half their reproductive resources in the production of males which, in turn, invest minimally into the progeny, as epitomised by the uncommonness of paternal care when it is not beneficial to the male \citep{smith1977parental,fromhage2007stability} — a concept known as the “twofold cost of sex” or “cost of meiosis” \citep{bell1982masterpiece}.
Second, the sexual act itself wastes time and energy to find and attract a sexual partner, and exposes the individual to the risks of contracting diseases and of being predated (sometimes by the mate itself), thus making sex a pearilous and unprofitable endeavour.

Nevertheless, only 80 \citep{vrijenhoek1989list,neaves2011unisexual} of the 70,000 vertebrate species discovered so far \citep{iucn2019} and as little as 0.1\% of all named animals \citep{vrijenhoek1998animal} reproduce otherwise than sexually. %More generally, although asexuality often arises, it rarely persists for long, thus suggesting that it is an evolutionary dead-end or that sex is hard to quit \citep{normarck2003genomic}.
Such pervasiveness of sex in nature constitutes indisputable proof of its evolutionary success. 

But, given its considerable drawkbacks, how come sex has superseded all other forms of reproduction?
% What then, given all the costs of sex, explains its pervasiveness in nature and where does its evolutionary success come from?
% How come then, given all its costs, that sex is so widespread in nature and what explains its evolutionary success?
Over 20 theories have been put forward to answer this question \citep{kondrashov1993classification}, but the most generally claimed advantages revolve around the idea that sex both eliminates deleterious mutations and brings up more favourable combinations of alleles \citep{normarck2003genomic, speijer2016can}.
This defensibly profitable reshuffling of alleles is called “recombination” and occurs during meiosis, the cellular process leading to the formation of gametes.\\

This chapter — named after a review on the subject \citep{hunter2015meiotic} — explores the details of the cytological features of meiosis and recombination with a particular focus on mammals, before venturing into the multiple models of meiotic recombination which still demand to be evidenced.

\section{Meiosis in the context of gametogenesis}

% \subsection{The production of gametes via two cellular divisions}
\subsection{A two-step division process to form gametes}

Most sexually-reproducing organisms have diploid cells, \textit{i.e.} cells that contain two sets of chromosomes: one from each parent.
The transmission of half this genetic material to their progeny goes through the formation of specialised haploid cells (\textit{i.e.} cells containing a single set of chromosomes) called “gametes”.
%, which later fuse with another coming from the second parent during a stage called “fertilisation” to form a “zygote”, the fertilised cell that will lead to the formation of a new individual. 
Such transition from diploidy to haploidy occurs during a particular type of cell division called “meiosis” (from the Greek word \textit{\textgreek{μ}\textepsilon\textgreek{ίωσις}}: “lessening”).

% Despite some clear differences between organisms \citep{hunter2003synaptonemal, loidl2016conservation}, the most salient features of meiosis are conserved among eukaryotes.
% This suggests that their last common ancestor had already acquired it \citep{cavalier2002origins,ramesh2005phylogenomic,speijer2015sex} through a process that is still largely debated \citep{wilkins2009evolution,bernstein2010evolutionary,bernstein2011meiosis}.

Concretely, meiosis is preceded by a unique round of chromosome duplication occurring during the interphase of diploid germinal cells (ovocytes in females and spermatocytes in males).
% Basically, meiosis consists of two successive cell divisions preceded by a unique round of chromosome duplication occurring during the interphase of diploid germinal cells (ovocytes in females and spermatocytes in males).
Thence, before entering meiosis, each homologous chromosome (or “homologue”) \textit{i.e.} each parental copy, is formed of two identical double-helix DNA molecules called “sister chromatids” which are physically attached at a point called the “centromere” and adjoined along their whole length by cohesins \citep{klein1999central}.
Therefrom, the two successive cell divisions that compose meiosis will result in the distribution of the chromatids into four gametes.

The first meiotic division is also known as the “reductional division” because it separates the pairs of homologues to form two haploid cells. 
It is classically divided into four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase (Figure~\ref{fig:meiosis-cytological-steps}, top).
Prophase I, described more extensively in Section~\ref{chap2:prophase-I}, stages the pairing of homologous chromosomes along with recombination.
Next, the meiotic splindle bonds the paired homologues and lines them up on the equatorial plate during metaphase I, before separating them during anaphase I. 
Such partition of homologues is achieved thanks to the existence of two opposite forces that stabilise the chromosomes until they are correctly oriented: first, the chiasmata that maintain the homologues attached and second, the meiotic spindle that creates a poleward tension \citep{petronczki2003menage}.
The co-segregation of sister chromatids is likely due to a physical jointure of their kinetochores \citep{nasmyth2015meiotic}.
Segregation \textit{per se} terminates at telophase I during which the chromosomes decondense and a nuclear enveloppe (NE) forms around the nuclei.
At the end of the first meiotic division, each of the two haploid daughter cells (“secondary gametocytes”) contains one pair of sister chromatids corresponding either to the paternal or to the maternal homologue.

Following a short interkinesis during which DNA does not replicate, the second meiotic division splits sister chromatids in a manner much similar to a haploid mitosis. 
This division is termed “equational” because the number of chromosomes stays equal before and after it.
Like the first one, it is partitioned into four stages (Figure~\ref{fig:meiosis-cytological-steps}, bottom) executed synchroneously in the two secondary gametocytes.
During prophase II, the NEs break down and the chromatids recondense. 
In the meantime, the centrosomes duplicated during interkinesis move towards opposite poles while a new meiotic spindle forms in between and starts to capture chromatids.
The single chromosomes line up across the equational plates of each cell during metaphase II and sister chromatids segregate towards opposing poles during anaphase II\@.
At telophase II, the chromosomes begin to decondense and new NEs form around them, thus producing the final set of four genetically-unique haploid gametes.\\

Even though these general features of meiosis are shared, its timing and the products it forms are sexually dimorphic in mammals \citep[reviewed in][]{handel2010genetics}. 
Indeed, male meiosis ends in the formation of four gametes (spermatids) whereas female meiosis ends in a single functional gamete and three non functional haploid cells called “polar bodies”.

As for the timing, all along male adulthood, spermatogonia mature into spermatocytes which then initiate meiosis. As such, this results in a continuous production of sperm.
In contrast, one common conception in females is that the integrality of oogonia mature into ovocytes during fetal development \citep{pearl1921studies,zuckerman1951number}, even though recent findings suggest that oocyte production may be sustained in the postnatal ovaries \citep{johnson2004germline,johnson2005oocyte}.
In any case, female meiotic prophase I — initiated and arrested right after the production of ovocytes — is resumed in small batches of ovocytes at periodic intervals during the reproductive lifespan.
It halts once again at metaphase II, until fertilisation by a spermatozoid (if it ever occurs) triggers the finalisation of the process.\\

While the transition from plain cell cycle to meiotic entry is managed by a complex body of checkpoints \citep[reviewed in][]{marston2005meiosis}, the metronomic completion of meiotic subprocesses is abundantly warranted by the capacity of chromosomes to respond to cell cycle controls \citep[reviewed in][]{mckim1995chromosomal}.
But the most regulated — and perhaps most critical — meiotic step is the synapsis of homologous chromosomes which takes place during prophase I.



\subsection{The synapsis of homologues during prophase I}
\label{chap2:prophase-I}

\subsubsection{Four differential degrees of synapsis}
Prophase I is commonly subdivided into four stages (Figure~\ref{fig:prophase-I-stages}): leptotene (or leptonema), zygotene (or zygonema), pachytene (or pachynema) and diplotene (or diplonema).
Each is characterised by a particular chromosomal configuration that mirrors their degree of “synapsis” \textit{i.e.} pairing of homologues.

At leptotene, chromosome ends connect the cytoskeleton located outside the nucleus \citep{scherthan1996centromere} \textit{via} their binding a complex body of SUN-domain proteins of the inner nuclear membrane (INM) that have beforehand bridged KASH-domain proteins of the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) \citep{tzur2006sun, yanowitz2010meiosis}.
This allows cytoplasmic forces to animate the motion of chromosome ends at the surface of the INM \citep{penkner2009meiotic} and ends at late leptotene by the formation of a “bouquet” (Figure~\ref{fig:prepairing}) \citep{zickler1998leptotene} which constrains the chromosomes to a limited nuclear area \citep{zickler2006early}.

At zygotene, the homologous chromosomes start to synapse, starting with the telomeric regions tethered in the bouquet \citep{pfeifer2003sex}.
By the end of pachytene, synapsis is complete for all pairs of chromosomes, with the notable exception of the non-homologous male X and Y chromosomes.
Instead, the sex chromosomes are transcriptionnally inactivated (“meiotic sex chromosome inactivation”, or MSCI) by remodelling into heterochromatin \citep{fernandez2003h2ax} and are pushed to the periphery of the nucleus where they form the “sex body” \citep{handel2004xy} (Figure~\ref{fig:prophase-I-stages}.e.).
Then, during diplotene, the homologous chromosomes desynapse but remain attached in pairs \textit{via} their chiasmata.

\subsubsection{Presynaptic pairing}
Matching homologous chromosomes into pairs constitutes the most critical event of synapsis.
This challenge is colossal: for human cells, it compares to finding a 20-cm stretch — other than the sister chromatid — throughout the London-Moscow distance, simulaneously for hundreds of sites and coordinately with higher-order cellular processes \citep{neale2006clarifying}.\\

This search is likely facilitated by the establishment of pre-meiotic physical contacts between homologues \citep[reviewed in][]{mckee2004homologous, zickler2006early}.
Such presynaptic pairing has been evidenced in mice \citep{boateng2013homologous} and, although its detailed mechanism remains ignored, several theories wrestle to explain its formation. 

According to one of them, presynaptic associations may occur through DNA-DNA duplexes \citep{danilowicz2009single}. 
This assumption relies on the observation that meiotic chromosomes pair only when they are transcriptionally active \citep{cook1997transcriptional}. 
DNA duplexes could thus momentarily form within the “transcription factory” to which DNA loops are attached \citep{xu2008similar}.
Alternatively, these associations may be promoted by sequence-specific RNA molecules, in a manner similar to gene silencing in plants and fungi \citep[cited in \citealp{zickler2006early}]{bender2004dna}.
A third scenario suggests a mechanism analogous to the “pairing centres” (PC) or “homologue recognition regions” (HRR) described in \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} \citep{villeneuve1994cis,macqueen2005chromosome}, \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} \citep{mckee1996license} and \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} \citep{kemp2004role}.
Namely, the \textit{cis}-acting PCs (or HRRs) could initiate interactions between homologues \citep{gerton2005homologous}.\\


In any case, demonstrating the existence of such presynaptic pairing in mice has driven \citet{boateng2013homologous} to propose a new model for homology search (Figure~\ref{fig:prepairing}).
With it, they challenge the commonly accepted view that homology search is triggered by the need to repair newly-opened DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).
Instead, they propose that DSBs occur after the pre-leptotene pairing and that their repair serves as a prophase checkpoint to proofread the initial connection.
If that were so, homology search for DSB repair would be restrained to a reduced territory and thus, much facilitated \citep{barzel2008finding,mirny2011fractal}.\\
%\citep[cited in \citealp{boateng2013homologous}]{mirny2011fractal}

Whether or not this view is correct, chromosomal movements allow random collisions between chromosomes \citep{fung1998homologous}, thus creating opportunities for homologues to encounter and, more importantly, to disrupt unwanted (non-homologous) associations \citep{koszul2009dynamic}.
Yet, at this stage, the interstitial interactions between homologues are transient and reversible \citep{boateng2013homologous}.
They thus need to be strengthened by a higher-order chromosomal structure: the synaptonemal complex (SC).

% Mutations that disrupt chromosome movements also result in loss of this nuclear reorganization during leptotene/zygotene (MacQueen and Villeneuve, 2001; Couteau et al., 2004; Couteau and Zetka, 2005; Martinez-Perez and Villeneuve, 2005; Penkner et al., 2007b).

		\par \citet{boateng2013homologous}'s model stipulates that the tethering of telomeres (green points) to the NE in late preleptotene facilitates the initiation of synapsis at subtelomeric regions by simplifying the search for the homologous chromosome (light and dark grey lines). 
		The authors also conjecture that, upon entry into prophase (leptotene), this DSB-independent pairing at non-telomeric sites is lost, but that telomeric pairing is maintained at least at one end until homologues recombine. 
		Ultimately, DSB repair and synapsis at zygotene and pachytene would progressively restore pairing at non-telomeric sites.
		This figure was reproduced from \citet{boateng2013homologous}.

\end{figure}




\subsubsection{The synaptonemal complex (SC)}
The synaptonemal complex (SC), discovered by \citet{fawcett1956fine} and \citet{moses1956chromosomal}, is a remarkably well-conserved ribbon-like proteinaceous structure composed of three units: two dense lateral (or axial) elements (LE) and — except in the green alga \textit{Ulva} \citep{braten1973ultrastructure} and \textit{Chlamydomonas} \citep{storms1977fine} — one less dense central element (CE) (Figure~\ref{fig:synaptonemal-complex}) \citep{schmekel1995central}.

LEs resemble axes along which the sister chromatids are loaded, binding short stretches of DNA to the LE and condensing the rest of it into long loops of tens to hundreds of kilo bases (kb). 
Generally, the loops closer to the telomeres are much shorter than the ones located elsewhere \citep{heng1996regulation}.

LE assembly begins at leptotene with the aggregation of both REC8 cohesins and axial proteins (SCP2 and SCP3 in mammals) into small fragments \citep{eijpe2003meiotic} which later fuse into full LEs \citep{schalk1998localization}.
At full synapsis, they are connected to the CE (formed of SYCE1 and SYCE2 proteins \citep{pera2013stem}) by transverse filaments (TFs), thus giving the SC a striated, zipper-like appearance.
The main constituent of TFs — the SCP1 protein, in mammals — has homologues in worms \citep{macqueen2002synapsis,colaiacovo2003synaptonemal}, flies \citep{mckim2002meiotic} and yeasts \citep[reviewed in][]{zickler1999meiotic} that, despite little sequence conservation, display a similar structure: two head-to-head homodimers of a ${\sim}80$~nm coiled coil flanked by globular C and N termini \citep{meuwissen1992coiled,liu1996localization}.
The polymerisation of these central region proteins between paired homologue axes results in the tight pairing (${\sim}100$~nm) of the bivalents\footnote{Homologous chromosomes} along their entire length at the end of pachytene \citep{page2004genetics}, as compared to their ${\sim}400$-nm spacing during presynaptic coalignement \citep{tesse2003localization}.\\

		progresses along pairs of homologous chromosomes in a zipper-like fashion. The axes of unsynapsed
		portions are called axial elements. Initial homologous interactions may or may not need axial elements. The
		sites of crossing over are marked by recombination nodules, which are located between the axial elements.”

\label{fig:synaptonemal-complex}
\end{figure}



Synapsis is indeed the most commonly acknowledged role of the SC, but it may also act to limit recombination with the sister chromatid.
Avoiding the sister may seem a trivial problem given the 2:1 odds ratio in favour of homologue templates \citep{lao2010trying}. 
However, an important guarantee of genome stability is the preferential use of the sister chromatid in mitotically dividing cells \citep{kadyk1992sister,bzymek2010double} which is likely promoted by their cohesin-dependent proximity \citep{sjogren2010sphase}.
Thus, switching this mitotic inter-sister bias to a meiotic inter-homologue bias is essential for synapsis.
Even though this could be ensured by other features of meiosis \citep[reviewed in \citealp{humphryes2014non}]{schwacha1997interhomolog, goldfarb2010frequent, hong2013logic}, recent evidence points that the components of the CE are effectively involved in template choice \citep{kim2010sister} as was suggested in the past \citep{haber1998meiosis}.\\

Microscopy observation of the SC show dense nodules where recombination occurs (“recombination nodules”: RN) \citep{carpenter1975electron, schmekel1998evidence}.
Indeed, the formation of DSBs is a prerequisite for SC formation in many species including plants and mammals \citep{zickler1999meiotic, henderson2004tying}.
Yet, the meiotic program seems to vary for other species: SC formation is recombination-independent in \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} \citep{dernburg1998meiotic}, \textit{Bombyx mori} \citep{rasmussen1977transformation} and \textit{Drosophila} females \citep{mckim1998meiotic} (and recombination does not even occur in \textit{Drosophila} males \citep[reviewed in][]{tsai2011homologous}) whereas \textit{Schizosaccharomyces pombe} \citep{bahler1993unusual} and \textit{Aspergillus nidulans} \citep{egel1982meiosis} recombinate but have no SC \citep[reviewed in][]{zickler2015recombination}.

More generally, whenever recombination is associated with the SC, it is clear that its correct formation is of paramount importance to create stable DNA connections between homologues \citep[reviewed in \citealp{hunter2003synaptonemal}]{hunter2001singleend}.
These form \textit{via} the process of homologous recombination.

% Recent data suggest that two classes of crossovers form in S. cerevisiae (and probably plants and mammals; e.g., de Los Santos et al., 2003). The majority, Class-I, is subject to distribution controls and dependent on Zip1 and at least five other meiosis-specific proteins (Börner, V., Kleckner, N. and N. Hunter, unpublished data). Loss of Class-I crossovers causes chromosomes to missegregate in most meioses, inferring a critical function for these events, and thus SC, in S. cerevisiae. In contrast, Class-II crossovers are randomly distributed and SC independent. Loss of these events does not affect SCs or cause chromosomes to missegregate.

Recombination was discovered by Thomas Hunt Morgan and his colleagues in the
early twentieth century. The concept of “gene conversion” was fi rst proposed by
Winkler in 1930 [ 11  ], but it was not fully accepted for a long time, until studies on
fungi clearly showed conversion events [ 12, 13  ]. Holliday (1964; [ 14  ]) proposed the
“Holliday structure” model (Fig. 2.14) to connect gene conversion, or nonreciprocal
transfer of DNA fragment, and recombination.


Early studies on gene conversion were mostly restricted to fungal genetics. As
molecular evolutionary studies of multigene family started, unexpected similarity
of tandemly arrayed rRNA genes was found [ 15  ]. This phenomenon was termed
“concerted evolution,” and gene conversion or unequal crossing-over was proposed
to explain this characteristic of some multigene families (e.g., [ 16  ]). New statistical
methods were developed to detect gene conversion between homologous
sequences [ 17, 18  ]. Program GENECONV developed by Sawyer [ 19  ] became the
standard tool for analyzing gene conversions. We now know that conversion can
occur in any genomic region irrespective of genes (DNA regions having function)
or nongenic regions (e.g., [ 20  ]). However, “gene conversion” as technical jargon is
currently widely accepted, and I follow this nomenclature. Gene conversion can be
classifi ed into two types: intragenic or between alleles and intergenic or between
duplicated genes. 


When Winkler [ 11  ] proposed gene conversion in 1930, it was a deviation from
the Mendelian ratio. Later, detailed observations on baker’s yeast and Neurospora
[ 12, 13  ] established gene conversion, and Holliday’s [ 14  ] model transformed
gene conversion from phenomenon to mechanism. Nowadays several enzymes
are known to be involved in DNA strand exchanges [ 30  ]. Abundant genome
sequence data and their computational analyses again turned gene conversion or
more fl atly homogenization of homologous sequences from mechanism to phenomenon. We should be careful of any prejudice to a particular phenomenon when we
try to interpret them with certain mechanism. One phenomenon, such as homologous sequence homogenization, may occur not only via gene conversion but with
some other mechanisms, including one unknown to us at this moment. It is obvious
that we should grasp molecular mechanism of gene conversion, including enzymatic
machineries.

Quand parle des maps de linkage: voir citation Muller %1920:98-101
“[I]t has never been claimed, in the theory of linear linkage, that the per cents of crossing over are actually proportional to the map distances: what has been stated is that the per cents of crossing overs are calculable from the map distances…”
