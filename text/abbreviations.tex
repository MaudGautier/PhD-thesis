		\item[Purebred] Bred from members of a recognized breed, strain, or kind without admixture of other blood over many generations.
		\item[Reciprocal cross] Breeding experiment designed to test the role of parental sex on a given inheritance pattern.
		\item[Gene conversion] A non-reciprocal recombination process that results in an alteration of the sequence of a gene to that of its homologue.
		\item[Chiasma] (plural chiasmata) an exchange (crossing-over) between paired chromatids, observed cytologically between diplotene and the first meiotic anaphase [160], from Greek χ´ıασµα (two lines placed cross-wise, like an X).
		\item[Tetrad analysis] Analysis of the four products (gametes) resulting from one single meiosis event.
		\item[Haploid] Organism (or phase) displaying a ploidy of 1 ($n=1$), i.e.\ a single set of chromosomes.
		\item[Diploid] Organism (or phase) displaying a ploidy of 2 ($n=2$), i.e.\ two sets of chromosomes (which are paired).
		\item[Ploidy] The number of complete sets of chromosomes ($n$) in a cell.
