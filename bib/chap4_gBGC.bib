  abstract = {I present evidence that natural selection biases synonymous codon usage to enhance the accuracy of protein synthesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Since the fitness cost of a translational misincorporation will depend on how the amino acid substitution affects protein function, selection for translational accuracy predicts an association between codon usage in DNA and functional constraint at the protein level. The frequency of preferred codons is significantly higher at codons conserved for amino acids than at nonconserved codons in 38 genes compared between D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis or Drosophila pseudoobscura (Z = 5.93, P {$<$} 10(-6)). Preferred codon usage is also significantly higher in putative zinc-finger and homeodomain regions than in the rest of 28 D. melanogaster transcription factor encoding genes (Z = 8.38, P {$<$} 10(-6)). Mutational alternatives (within-gene differences in mutation rates, amino acid changes altering codon preference states, and doublet mutations at adjacent bases) do not appear to explain this association between synonymous codon usage and amino acid constraint.},

Here, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequence, DNA microarray expression data, tRNA gene numbers, and functional categorizations of proteins are employed to determine whether the amino acid composition of peptides reflects natural selection to optimize the speed and accuracy of translation. Strong relationships between synonymous codon usage bias and estimates of transcript abundance suggest that DNA array data serve as adequate predictors of translation rates. Amino acid usage also shows striking relationships with expression levels. Stronger correlations between tRNA concentrations and amino acid abundances among highly expressed proteins than among less abundant proteins support adaptation of both tRNA abundances and amino acid usage to enhance the speed and accuracy of protein synthesis. Natural selection for efficient synthesis appears to also favor shorter proteins as a function of their expression levels. Comparisons restricted to proteins within functional classes are employed to control for differences in amino acid composition and protein size that reflect differences in the functional requirements of proteins expressed at different levels.},

  abstract = {The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a set of genes that show strong amino acid sequence similarity to MutS and MutL, proteins required for mismatch repair in Escherichia coli. We examined the role of MSH2 and PMS1, yeast homologs of mutS and mutL, respectively, in the repair of base pair mismatches formed during meiotic recombination. By using specifically marked HIS4 and ARG4 alleles, we showed that msh2 mutants displayed a severe defect in the repair of all base pair mismatches as well as 1-, 2- and 4-bp insertion/deletion mispairs. The msh2 and pms1 phenotypes were indistinguishable, suggesting that the wild-type gene products act in the same repair pathway. A comparison of gene conversion events in wild-type and msh2 mutants indicated that mismatch repair plays an important role in genetic recombination. (1) Tetrad analysis at five different loci revealed that, in msh2 mutants, the majority of aberrant segregants displayed a sectored phenotype, consistent with a failure to repair mismatches created during heteroduplex formation. In wild type, base pair mismatches were almost exclusively repaired toward conversion rather than restoration. (2) In msh2 strains 10-19\% of the aberrant tetrads were Ab4:4. (3) Polarity gradients at HIS4 and ARG4 were nearly abolished in msh2 mutants. The frequency of gene conversion at the 3' end of these genes was increased and was nearly the frequency observed at the 5' end. (4) Co-conversion studies were consistent with mismatch repair acting to regulate heteroduplex DNA tract length. We favor a model proposing that recombination events occur through the formation and resolution of heteroduplex intermediates and that mismatch repair proteins specifically interact with recombination enzymes to regulate the length of symmetric heteroduplex DNA.},

  abstract = {Differences in the regional substitution patterns in the human genome created patterns of large-scale variation of base composition known as genomic isochores. To gain insight into the origin of the genomic isochores, we develop a maximum-likelihood approach to determine the history of substitution patterns in the human genome. This approach utilizes the vast amount of repetitive sequence deposited in the human genome over the past approximately 250 Myr. Using this approach, we estimate the frequencies of seven types of substitutions: the four transversions, two transitions, and the methyl-assisted transition of cytosine in CpG. Comparing substitutional patterns in repetitive elements of various ages, we reconstruct the history of the base-substitutional process in the different isochores for the past 250 Myr. At around 90 MYA (around the time of the mammalian radiation), we find an abrupt fourfold to eightfold increase of the cytosine transition rate in CpG pairs compared with that of the reptilian ancestor. Further analysis of nucleotide substitutions in regions with different GC content reveals concurrent changes in the substitutional patterns. Although the substitutional pattern was dependent on the regional GC content in such ways that it preserved the regional GC content before the mammalian radiation, it lost this dependence afterward. The substitutional pattern changed from an isochore-preserving to an isochore-degrading one. We conclude that isochores have been established before the radiation of the eutherian mammals and have been subject to the process of homogenization since then.},

  abstract = {The HINTW gene on the female-specific W chromosome of chicken and other birds is amplified and present in numerous copies. Moreover, as HINTW is distinctly different from its homolog on the Z chromosome (HINTZ), is a candidate gene in avian sex determination, and evolves rapidly under positive selection, it shows several common features to ampliconic and testis-specific genes on the mammalian Y chromosome. A phylogenetic analysis within galliform birds (chicken, turkey, quail, and pheasant) shows that individual HINTW copies within each species are more similar to each other than to gene copies of related species. Such convergent evolution is most easily explained by recurrent events of gene conversion, the rate of which we estimated at 10(-6)-10(-5) per site and generation. A significantly higher GC content of HINTW than of other W-linked genes is consistent with biased gene conversion increasing the fixation probability of mutations involving G and C nucleotides. Furthermore, and as a likely consequence, the neutral substitution rate is almost twice as high in HINTW as in other W-linked genes. The region on W encompassing the HINTW gene cluster is not covered in the initial assembly of the chicken genome, but analysis of raw sequence reads indicates that gene copy number is significantly higher than a previous estimate of 40. While sexual selection is one of several factors that potentially affect the evolution of ampliconic, male-specific genes on the mammalian Y chromosome, data from HINTW provide evidence that gene amplification followed by gene conversion can evolve in female-specific chromosomes in the absence of sexual selection. The presence of multiple and highly similar copies of HINTW may be related to protein function, but, more generally, amplification and conversion offers a means to the avoidance of accumulation of deleterious mutations in nonrecombining chromosomes.},

In this paper, we investigate the compositional properties of coding sequences from a broad range of vertebrate poikilotherms using DNA sequence analysis. We find that on average poikilotherms have lower third-codon position GC contents (GC3) than homeotherms but that some poikilotherms have higher mean GC3 values. We find that most poikilotherms have lower variation in GC3 than homeotherms but that there is a correlation between GC12 and GC3 for some species, indicating that there is systematic variation in base composition across their genomes. We also demonstrate that the GC3 of genes in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, is correlated with that in humans, suggesting that vertebrates share a basic isochore structure. However, we find no correlation between either the mean GC3 or the standard deviation in GC3 and body temperature.},

Here we investigated the evolution of the GC content of 41 coding genes in 6 to 66 species of mammals by estimating the ancestral GC content using a method which allows for different rates of substitution between sites. We found a highly significant decrease in the GC content during early mammalian evolution, as well as a weaker but still significant decrease in the GC content of GC-rich genes later in at least three groups of mammals: primates, rodents, and carnivores. These results are of interest because they confirm the recently suggested disappearance of GC-rich isochores in some mammalian genomes, and more importantly, they suggest that this disappearance started very early in mammalian evolution.},

Over 98\% of the 1004 amino acid residues analyzed by DNA sequencing are coded for by a select 25 of the 61 possible coding triplets. These preferred codons tend to be highly homologous to the anticodons of the major yeast isoacceptor tRNA species. Codons which necessitate site by side GC base pairs between the codons and the tRNA anticodons are always avoided whenever possible. Codons containing 100\% G, C, A, U, GC, or AU are also avoided. This provides for approximately equivalent codon-anticodon binding energies for all preferred triplets. All sequenced yeast genes show a distinct preference for these same 25 codons. The degree of preference varies from greater than 90\% for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ADH-I to less than 20\% for iso-2 cytochrome c. The degree of bias for these 25 preferred triplets in each gene is correlated with the level of its mRNA in the cytoplasm. Genes which are strongly expressed are more biased than genes with a lower level of expression. A similar phenomenon is observed in the codon preferences of highly expressed genes in Escherichia coli. High levels of gene expression are well correlated with high levels of codon bias toward 22 of the 61 coding triplets. As in yeast, these preferred codons are highly complementary to the major cellular isoacceptor tRNA species. In at least four cases (Ala, Arg, Leu, and Val), these preferred E. coli codons are incompatible with the preferred yeast codons.},

To determine the forces that cause increased evolutionary rates in certain genes, we analyzed alignments of 10,238 human genes to their orthologues in chimpanzee and macaque. Using a likelihood ratio test, we identified protein-coding sequences with an accelerated rate of base substitutions along the human lineage. Exons evolving at a fast rate in humans have a significant tendency to contain clusters of AT-to-GC (weak-to-strong) biased substitutions. This pattern is also observed in noncoding sequence flanking rapidly evolving exons. Accelerated exons occur in regions with elevated male recombination rates and exhibit an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions relative to the genomic average. We next analyzed genes with significantly elevated ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous rates of base substitution (dN/dS) along the human lineage, and those with an excess of amino acid replacement substitutions relative to human polymorphism. These genes also show evidence of clusters of weak-to-strong biased substitutions. These findings indicate that a recombination-associated process, such as biased gene conversion (BGC), is driving fixation of GC alleles in the human genome. This process can lead to accelerated evolution in coding sequences and excess amino acid replacement substitutions, thereby generating significant results for tests of positive selection.},

Indeed, DNAs from cold-blooded vertebrates are characterized by much lower intermolecular compositional heterogeneities and CsCl band asymmetries, by a much wider spectrum of modal buoyant densities in CsCl, by generally lower amounts of satellites, as well as by the fact that in no case do buoyant densities reach the high values found in the GC-richest components of DNAs from warm-blooded vertebrates.In the case of fish genomes, which were more extensively studied, different orders were generally characterized by modal buoyant densities that were different in average values as well as in their ranges. In contrast, different families within any given order were more often characterized by narrow ranges of modal buoyant densities, and no difference in modal buoyant density was found within any single genus (except for the genusAphyosemion, which should be split into several genera).The compositional differences that were found among species belonging to different orders and to different families within the same order are indicative of compositional transitions, which were shown to be essentially due to directional base substitutions. These transitions were found to be independent of geological time. Moreover, the rates of directional base substitutions were found to be very variable and to reach, in some cases, extremely high values, that were even higher than those of silent substitutions in primates. The taxonomic and evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed.},

Isochores can be partitioned in a small number of families that cover a range of GC levels (GC is the molar ratio of guanine+cytosine in DNA), which is narrow in cold-blooded vertebrates, but broad in warm-blooded vertebrates. This difference is essentially due to the fact that the GC-richest 10-15\% of the genomes of the ancestors of mammals and birds underwent two independent compositional transitions characterized by strong increases in GC levels. The similarity of isochore patterns across mammalian orders, on the one hand, and across avian orders, on the other, indicates that these higher GC levels were then maintained, at least since the appearance of ancestors of warm-blooded vertebrates. After a brief review of our current knowledge on the organization of the vertebrate genome, evidence will be presented here in favor of the idea that the generation and maintenance of the GC-richest isochores in the genomes of warm-blooded vertebrates were due to natural selection.},

Isochores belong, however, to a small number of families that cover a very broad GC range (GC is the molar percentage of guanine + cytosine in DNA). An isochore pattern is very widespread in eukaryotes. This pattern (the ``genome phenotype'') is stable over geological times, but is different in different vertebrate and plant classes. In all vertebrates, there are good correlations between the GC levels of coding and contiguous noncoding sequences, as well as among the GC levels of different codon positions. Such correlations amount to a ``genomic code''. Gene distribution is bimodal in vertebrates, gene density being very high in the small ``genome core'' (corresponding in the human genome to the GC-richest isochore families H2 + H3) and very low in the vast ``genome desert'' (formed by the other isochore families L1, L2, and H1). The gene distribution of vertebrates is correlated with important structural, functional, and evolutionary features.},

  abstract = {The vertebrate genome is a mosaic of GC-poor and GC-rich isochores, megabase-sized DNA regions of fairly homogeneous base composition that differ in relative amount, gene density, gene expression, replication timing, and recombination frequency. At the emergence of warm-blooded vertebrates, the gene-rich, moderately GC-rich isochores of the cold-blooded ancestors underwent a GC increase. This increase was similar in mammals and birds and was maintained during the evolution of mammalian and avian orders. Neither the GC increase nor its conservation can be accounted for by the random fixation of neutral or nearly neutral single-nucleotide changes (i.e., the vast majority of nucleotide substitutions) or by a biased gene conversion process occurring at random genome locations. Both phenomena can be explained, however, by the neoselectionist theory of genome evolution that is presented here. This theory fully accepts Ohta's nearly neutral view of point mutations but proposes in addition (i) that the AT-biased mutational input present in vertebrates pushes some DNA regions below a certain GC threshold; (ii) that these lower GC levels cause regional changes in chromatin structure that lead to deleterious effects on replication and transcription; and (iii) that the carriers of these changes undergo negative (purifying) selection, the final result being a compositional conservation of the original isochore pattern in the surviving population. Negative selection may also largely explain the GC increase accompanying the emergence of warm-blooded vertebrates. In conclusion, the neoselectionist theory not only provides a solution to the neutralist/selectionist debate but also introduces an epigenomic component in genome evolution.},

  abstract = {In most eukaryotes, genetic information is exchanged between homologous chromosomes via the process of recombination. As part of this process, short deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) tracts of less than 1 kb in length are exchanged between chromosomes in an asymmetric fashion in a process known as gene conversion. When such gene conversion events occur within the vicinity of heterozygous loci, this asymmetric exchange of DNA can result in the non-Mendelian transmission of alleles. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that this non-Mendelian transmission is biased in favour of G and C alleles at the expense of A and T alleles. This process, known as biased gene conversion, has a number of important implications for understanding the behaviour of alleles within a population and the base composition of the genome itself. Key Concepts: Biased gene conversion is the preferential transmission of certain alleles to the next generation, arising from asymmetries in the gene conversion process. Biased gene conversion appears to preferentially favour GC alleles over AT alleles, resulting in the overtransmission of GC alleles in regions of high recombination. Biased gene conversion can increase the frequency of an allele in a population. Consistent biased gene conversion can ultimately influence the base composition of the genome, leading to increased levels of GC content. Although a difficult phenomenon to measure, multiple lines of experimental and evolutionary evidence support the existence of biased gene conversion.},

  abstract = {A strong negative correlation between the rate of amino-acid substitution and codon usage bias in Drosophila has been attributed to interference between positive selection at nonsynonymous sites and weak selection on codon usage. To further explore this possibility we have investigated polymorphism and divergence at three kinds of sites: synonymous, nonsynonymous and intronic in relation to codon bias in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. We confirmed that protein evolution is one of the main explicative parameters for interlocus codon bias variation (r(2) approximately 40\%). However, intron or synonymous diversities, which could have been expected to be good indicators of local interference [here defined as the additional increase of drift due to selection on tightly linked sites, also called 'genetic draft' by Gillespie (2000)] did not covary significantly with codon bias or with protein evolution. Concurrently, levels of polymorphism were reduced in regions of low recombination rates whereas codon bias was not. Finally, while nonsynonymous diversities were very well correlated between species, neither synonymous nor intron diversities observed in D. melanogaster were correlated with those observed in D. simulans. All together, our results suggest that the selective constraint on the protein is a stable component of gene evolution while local interference is not. The pattern of variation in genetic draft along the genome therefore seems to be instable through evolutionary times and should therefore be considered as a minor determinant of codon bias variance. We argue that selective constraints for optimal codon usage are likely to be correlated with selective constraints on the protein, both between codons within a gene, as previously suggested, and also between genes within a genome.},

Extrachromosomal recombination was stimulated by double-strand breaks in regions of shared homology. Recombination was predicted to occur via single-strand annealing, yielding heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) with a single mismatch. Nicks were expected on opposite strands flanking hDNA, equidistant from the mismatch. Unlike studies of covalently closed artificial hDNA substrates, all mismatches were efficiently repaired, consistent with a nick-driven repair process. The average repair efficiency for all mispairs was 92\%, with no significant differences among mispairs. There was significant strand-independent repair of G-T --{$>$} G-C, with a slightly greater bias in a CpG context. Repair of C-A was also biased (toward C-G), but no A-C --{$>$} G-C bias was found, a possible sequence context effect. No other mismatches showed evidence of biased repair, but among hetero-mismatches, the trend was toward retention of C or G vs. A or T. Repair of both T-T and G-T mismatches was much less efficient in mismatch repair-deficient cells (approximately 25\%), and the residual G-T repair was completely biased toward G-C. Our data indicate that single-base mismatches in recombination intermediates are substrates for at least two competing repair systems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene regulation is considered one of the driving forces of evolution. Although protein-coding DNA sequences and RNA genes have been subject to recent evolutionary events in the human lineage, it has been hypothesized that the large phenotypic divergence between humans and chimpanzees has been driven mainly by changes in gene regulation rather than altered protein-coding gene sequences. Comparative analysis of vertebrate genomes has revealed an abundance of evolutionarily conserved but noncoding sequences. These conserved noncoding (CNC) sequences may well harbor critical regulatory variants that have driven recent human evolution.
RESULTS: Here we identify 1,356 CNC sequences that appear to have undergone dramatic human-specific changes in selective pressures, at least 15\% of which have substitution rates significantly above that expected under neutrality. The 1,356 'accelerated CNC' (ANC) sequences are enriched in recent segmental duplications, suggesting a recent change in selective constraint following duplication. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms within ANC sequences have a significant excess of high frequency derived alleles and high F(ST) values relative to controls, indicating that acceleration and positive selection are recent in human populations. Finally, a significant number of single nucleotide polymorphisms within ANC sequences are associated with changes in gene expression. The probability of variation in an ANC sequence being associated with a gene expression phenotype is fivefold higher than variation in a control CNC sequence.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that ANC sequences have until very recently played a role in human evolution, potentially through lineage-specific changes in gene regulation.},

  abstract = {This study presents compelling evidence that recombination significantly increases the silent GC content of a genome in a selectively neutral manner, resulting in a highly significant positive correlation between recombination and "GC3s" in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Neither selection nor mutation can explain this relationship. A highly significant GC-biased mismatch repair system is documented for the first time in any member of the Kingdom Fungi. Much of the variation in the GC3s within yeast appears to result from GC-biased gene conversion. Evidence suggests that GC-biased mismatch repair exists in numerous organisms spanning six kingdoms. This transkingdom GC mismatch repair bias may have evolved in response to a ubiquitous AT mutational bias. A significant positive correlation between recombination and GC content is found in many of these same organisms, suggesting that the processes influencing the evolution of the yeast genome may be a general phenomenon. Nonrecombining regions of the genome and nonrecombining genomes would not be subject to this type of molecular drive. It is suggested that the low GC content characteristic of many nonrecombining genomes may be the result of three processes (1) a prevailing AT mutational bias, (2) random fixation of the most common types of mutation, and (3) the absence of the GC-biased gene conversion which, in recombining organisms, permits the reversal of the most common types of mutation. A model is proposed to explain the observation that introns, intergenic regions, and pseudogenes typically have lower GC content than the silent sites of corresponding open reading frames. This model is based on the observation that the greater the heterology between two sequences, the less likely it is that recombination will occur between them. According to this "Constraint" hypothesis, the formation and propagation of heteroduplex DNA is expected to occur, on average, more frequently within conserved coding and regulatory regions of the genome. In organisms possessing GC-biased mismatch repair, this would enhance the GC content of these regions through biased gene conversion. These findings have a number of important implications for the way we view genome evolution and suggest a new model for the evolution of sex.},

  abstract = {The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates ({$\omega$}) is often used to measure the strength of natural selection. However, {$\omega$} may be influenced by linkage among different targets of selection, that is, Hill-Robertson interference (HRI), which reduces the efficacy of selection. Recombination modulates the extent of HRI but may also affect {$\omega$} by means of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), a process leading to a preferential fixation of G:C ("strong," S) over A:T ("weak," W) alleles. As HRI and gBGC can have opposing effects on {$\omega$}, it is essential to understand their relative impact to make proper inferences of {$\omega$}. We used a model that separately estimated S-to-S, S-to-W, W-to-S, and W-to-W substitution rates in 8,423 avian genes in the Ficedula flycatcher lineage. We found that the W-to-S substitution rate was positively, and the S-to-W rate negatively, correlated with recombination rate, in accordance with gBGC but not predicted by HRI. The W-to-S rate further showed the strongest impact on both dN and dS. However, since the effects were stronger at 4-fold than at 0-fold degenerated sites, likely because the GC content of these sites is farther away from its equilibrium, {$\omega$} slightly decreases with increasing recombination rate, which could falsely be interpreted as a consequence of HRI. We corroborated this hypothesis analytically and demonstrate that under particular conditions, {$\omega$} can decrease with increasing recombination rate. Analyses of the site-frequency spectrum showed that W-to-S mutations were skewed toward high, and S-to-W mutations toward low, frequencies, consistent with a prevalent gBGC-driven fixation bias.},

A biochemical model is then developed to predict the magnitude of selective differences between synonymous codons in unicellular organisms in which growth rate (or possibly growth yield) can be equated with fitness. Selection can arise from differences in either the speed or the accuracy of translation. A model for the effect of speed of translation on fitness is considered in detail, a similar model for accuracy more briefly. The model is successful in predicting a difference in the degree of bias at the beginning than in the rest of the gene under some circumstances, as observed in Escherichia coli, but grossly overestimates the amount of bias expected.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A major goal in the study of human evolution is to identify key genetic changes which occurred over the course of primate evolution. According to one school of thought, many such changes are likely to be found in noncoding sequence. An approach to identifying these involves comparing multiple genomes to identify conserved regions with an accelerated substitution rate in a particular lineage. Such acceleration could be the result of positive selection.
RESULTS: Here we develop a likelihood ratio test method to identify such regions. We apply it not only to the human terminal lineage, as has been done in previous studies, but also to a number of other branches in the primate tree. We present the top scoring elements, and compare our results with previous studies. We also present resequencing data from one particular element accelerated on the human lineage. These data indicate that the element lies in a region of low polymorphism in humans, consistent with the possibility of a recent selective sweep. They also show that the AT to GC bias for polymorphism in this region differs dramatically from that for substitutions.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that screens of this type will be helpful in unraveling the complex set of changes which occurred during primate evolution.},

Under conditions in which repetitive sequences are competed out, the H3 isochore probe only or predominantly hybridized on the GC-richest fractions of main-band DNA from all the species investigated. These results indicate that single-copy sequences from the human H3 isochores share homology with sequences located in the compositionally corresponding compartments of the vertebrate genomes tested. These sequences are likely to be essentially formed by conserved coding sequences. The present results add to other lines of evidence indicating that isochore patterns are highly conserved in warm-blooded vertebrate genomes. Moreover, they refine recent reports (Sabeur et al., 1993; Kadi et al., 1993), and correct them in some details and also in demonstrating that the shrew genome does not exhibit the general mammalian pattern, but a special pattern.},

  abstract = {GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) is a recombination-associated process that favors the fixation of G/C alleles over A/T alleles. In mammals, gBGC is hypothesized to contribute to variation in GC content, rapidly evolving sequences, and the fixation of deleterious mutations, but its prevalence and general functional consequences remain poorly understood. gBGC is difficult to incorporate into models of molecular evolution and so far has primarily been studied using summary statistics from genomic comparisons. Here, we introduce a new probabilistic model that captures the joint effects of natural selection and gBGC on nucleotide substitution patterns, while allowing for correlations along the genome in these effects. We implemented our model in a computer program, called phastBias, that can accurately detect gBGC tracts about 1 kilobase or longer in simulated sequence alignments. When applied to real primate genome sequences, phastBias predicts gBGC tracts that cover roughly 0.3\% of the human and chimpanzee genomes and account for 1.2\% of human-chimpanzee nucleotide differences. These tracts fall in clusters, particularly in subtelomeric regions; they are enriched for recombination hotspots and fast-evolving sequences; and they display an ongoing fixation preference for G and C alleles. They are also significantly enriched for disease-associated polymorphisms, suggesting that they contribute to the fixation of deleterious alleles. The gBGC tracts provide a unique window into historical recombination processes along the human and chimpanzee lineages. They supply additional evidence of long-term conservation of megabase-scale recombination rates accompanied by rapid turnover of hotspots. Together, these findings shed new light on the evolutionary, functional, and disease implications of gBGC. The phastBias program and our predicted tracts are freely available.},

  abstract = {It has been hypothesized that evolutionary changes will be more frequent in later ontogeny than early ontogeny because of developmental constraint. To test this hypothesis, a genomewide examination of molecular evolution through ontogeny was carried out using comparative genomic data in Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae. We found that the mean rate of amino acid replacement is not significantly different between genes expressed during and after embryogenesis. However, synonymous substitution rates differed significantly between these two classes. A genomewide survey of correlation between codon bias and expression level found codon bias to be significantly correlated with mRNA expression (r(s) = -0.30 and P {$<$} 10(-131)) but does not alone explain differences in dS between classes. Surprisingly, it was found that genes expressed after embryogenesis have a significantly greater number of duplicates in both the C. elegans and C. briggsae genomes (P {$<$} 10(-20) and P {$<$} 10(-13)) when compared with early-expressed and nonmodulated genes. A similarity in the distribution of duplicates of nonmodulated and early-expressed genes, as well as a disproportionately higher number of early pseudogenes, lend support to the hypothesis that this difference in duplicate number is caused by selection against gene duplicates of early-expressed genes, reflecting developmental constraint. Developmental constraint at the level of gene duplication may have important implications for macroevolutionary change.},

They can be calculated either from absorbance profiles of the DNA in CsCl density gradients at sedimentation equilibrium, or by scanning long contigs of largely sequenced genomes. In the present study, we address the quantitative characterization of the compositional heterogeneity of genomes, as measured by the GC distributions of fixed-length fragments. Special attention is given to mammalian genomes, since their compartmentalization into isochores implies two levels of heterogeneity, intra-isochore (local) and inter-isochore (global). This partitioning is a natural one, since large-scale compositional properties vary much more among isochores than within them. Intra-isochore GC distributions become roughly Gaussian for long fragments, and their standard deviations decrease only slowly with increasing fragment length, unlike random sequences. This effect can be explained by `long-range' correlations, often overlooked, that are present along isochores.},

This process is known as GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). Until recently, genome-wide measures of fine-scale recombination activity were unavailable in mice. Additionally, comparative studies focusing on mouse were limited as the closest organism with its genome fully sequenced was rat. Here, we make use of the recent mapping of double strand breaks (DSBs), the first step of meiotic recombination, in the mouse genome and of the sequencing of mouse closely related subspecies to analyze the fine-scale evolutionary signature of meiotic recombination on GC-content evolution in recombination hotspots, short regions that undergo extreme rates of recombination. We measure substitution rates around DSB hotspots and observe that gBGC is affecting a very short region ({$\approx$} 1 kbp) in length around these hotspots. Furthermore, we can infer that the locations of hotspots evolved rapidly during mouse evolution.},

Some species, such as the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, are relatively GC-poor and homogeneous while others, such as grasses, are highly heterogeneous and GC-rich. The causes of these variations are still debated: are they mainly due to selective or neutral processes? Answering to this question is important to correctly infer whether variations in base composition may have functional roles or not. We extended a population genetics method to jointly estimate the different forces that may affect synonymous variations and applied it to genomic datasets in 11 flowering plant species. We found that GC-biased gene conversion, a neutral process associated with recombination that mimics selection by favouring G and C bases, is a widespread and stronger process than selection and that it could explain the large variation in base composition observed in plant genomes. Our results bear implications for analysing plant genomes and for correctly interpreting what could be functional or not.},

First, in addition to a strong effect of isochores, we have detected the influence of transcription-associated mutational biases (TAMB) on gene composition. Genes expressed in different tissues show diverse degrees of TAMB, with genes expressed in testis showing the greatest influence. Second, the study of tissues with no evidence of TAMB reveals a consistent set of optimal synonymous codons favored in highly expressed genes. This result exposes the consequences of natural selection on synonymous composition to increase efficiency of translation in the human lineage. Third, overall amino acid composition of proteins closely resembles tRNA abundance but there is no difference in amino acid composition in differentially expressed genes. Fourth, there is a negative relationship between expression and CDS length. Significantly, this is observed only among genes with introns, suggesting that the cause for this relationship in humans cannot be associated only with costs of amino acid biosynthesis. Fifth, we show that broadly and highly expressed genes have more, although shorter, introns. The selective advantage for having more introns in highly expressed genes is likely counterbalanced by containment of transcriptional costs and a minimum exon size for proper splicing.},

Precisely defining in terms of size and composition as well as mapping the isochores on human chromosomes have, however, remained largely unsolved problems. Here we used a very simple approach to segment the human chromosomes de novo, based on assessments of GC and its variation within and between adjacent regions. We obtain a complete coverage of the human genome (neglecting the remaining gaps) by approximately 3200 isochores, which may be visualized as the ultimate chromosomal bands. Isochores visibly belong to five families characterized by different GC levels, as expected from previous investigations. Since we previously showed that isochores are tightly linked to basic biological properties such as gene density, replication timing, and recombination, the new level of detail provided by the isochore map will help the understanding of genome structure, function, and evolution.},

  abstract = {Chromosome replication timing is biphasic (early\textendash{}late) in the cell cycle of vertebrates and of most (possibly all) eukaryotes. In the present work we have compared the extended, detailed replication timing maps that are available, namely those of human chromosomes 6, 11q, and 21q, with chromosomal bands as visualized at low (400 bands), high (850 bands), and highest (3,200 isochores) resolution. We have observed that the replicons located in a given isochore practically always show either all early or all late replication timing and that early-replicating isochores are short and GC-rich and late-replicating isochores are long and GC-poor. In the vast majority of cases, replicons are clustered in isochores, which are themselves most often clustered in early- or late-replication timing zones and may often reach the size of high-resolution bands and, very rarely, even that of low-resolution bands. Finally, we show that our results should be representative for the whole human genome and thus help to predict replication timing zones in all chromosomes.},

In fact, the analytical profile of human DNA showed that the vertebrate genome is a mosaic of isochores, typically megabase-size DNA segments that belong to a small number of families characterized by different GC levels. In this review, we will concentrate on some general genome features regarding the compositional organization from different organisms and their evolution, ranging from vertebrates to invertebrates until unicellular organisms. Since isochores are tightly linked to biological properties such as gene density, replication timing, and recombination, the new level of detail provided by the isochore map helped the understanding of genome structure, function, and evolution. All the findings reported here confirm the idea that the isochores can be considered as a "fundamental level of genome structure and organization." We stress that we do not discuss in this review the origin of isochores, which is still a matter of controversy, but we focus on well established structural and physiological aspects.},

In the present work, the four major components of mouse and human DNAs were prepared and characterized in several basic properties: relative amounts, dG + dC contents, buoyant densities and compositional heterogeneity. The results obtained lead to the following conclusions: (a) the major DNA components of mouse and man form at least 85\% and possibly the totality of the main bands of these DNAs; (b) they have very low compositional heterogeneities over a wide molecular weight range; (c) they derive from very large chromosomal DNA segments of fairly homogeneous base composition, for which the name `isochores' is proposed. A comparison of the compositional heterogeneity of main-band DNAs from warm-blooded and cold-blooded vertebrates confirms our previous conclusion that these DNAs are characterized by a different sequence organization.},

  abstract = {Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) degrades transcripts that contain a premature STOP codon resulting from mistranscription or missplicing. However NMD's surveillance of gene expression varies in efficiency both among and within human genes. Previous work has shown that the intron content of human genes is influenced by missplicing events invisible to NMD. Given the high rate of transcriptional errors in eukaryotes, we hypothesized that natural selection has promoted a dual strategy of ``prevention and cure'' to alleviate the problem of nonsense transcriptional errors. A prediction of this hypothesis is that NMD's inefficiency should leave a signature of ``transcriptional robustness'' in human gene sequences that reduces the frequency of nonsense transcriptional errors. For human genes we determined the usage of ``fragile'' codons, prone to mistranscription into STOP codons, relative to the usage of ``robust'' codons that do not generate nonsense errors. We observe that single-exon genes have evolved to become robust to mistranscription, because they show a significant tendency to avoid fragile codons relative to robust codons when compared to multi-exon genes. A similar depletion is evident in last exons of multi-exon genes. Histone genes are particularly depleted of fragile codons and thus highly robust to transcriptional errors. Finally, the protein products of single-exon genes show a strong tendency to avoid those amino acids that can only be encoded using fragile codons. Each of these observations can be attributed to NMD deficiency. Thus, in the human genome, wherever the ``cure'' for nonsense (i.e. NMD) is inefficient, there is increased reliance on the strategy of nonsense ``prevention'' (i.e. transcriptional robustness). This study shows that human genes are exposed to the deleterious influence of transcriptional errors. Moreover, it suggests that gene expression errors are an underestimated phenomenon, in molecular evolution in general and in selection for genomic robustness in particular., In biological systems mistakes are made constantly because the cellular machinery is complex and error-prone. Mistakes are made in copying DNA for transmission to offspring (``genetic mutations'') but are much more frequent in the day-to-day task of gene expression. Genetic mutations are heritable and therefore have long been the almost exclusive focus of evolutionary genetics research. In contrast, gene expression errors are not inherited and have tended to be disregarded in evolutionary studies. Here we show how human genes have evolved a mechanism to reduce the occurrence of a specific type of gene expression error\textemdash{}transcriptional errors that create premature STOP codons (so-called ``nonsense errors''). Nonsense errors are potentially highly toxic for the cell, so natural selection has evolved a strategy called Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) to ``cure'' such errors. However this cure is inefficient. Here we describe how a preventative strategy of ``transcriptional robustness'' has evolved to decrease the frequency of nonsense errors. Moreover, these ``prevention and cure'' strategies are used interchangeably\textemdash{}the most transcriptionally robust genes are those for which NMD is most inefficient. Our work implies that gene expression errors play an important role as supporting actors to genetic mutations in molecular evolution, particularly in the evolution of robustness.},

Signatures of selection reveal that the {$<$}em{$>$}Prl{$<$}/em{$>$} gene in Indian mice was the result of a full sweep originating from a highly diverged species of mouse. In terms of recombination, the linkage-disequilibrium based rate map of the French and Taiwanese mice is shown to be highly punctuate, while the Indian rate map is comparatively flat, and devoid of population level hotspots. The recombination landscape is shown to dominate nucleotide substitution, notably in the Indian mice, where it reverses a 2:1 strong (C/G) to weak (A/T) mutation bias in favour of a 2:1 weak to strong fixation rate. Dozens of long-extinct, and active, PRDM9 motifs are identified through a comparative genomic approach, which also reveals a highly localized picture of the distribution of GC-biased gene conversion.

  abstract = {The genomes of related species contain valuable information on the history of the considered taxa. Great apes in particular exhibit variation of evolutionary patterns along their genomes. However, the great ape data also bring new challenges, such as the presence of incomplete lineage sorting and ancestral shared polymorphisms. Previous methods for genome-scale analysis are restricted to very few individuals or cannot disentangle the contribution of mutation rates and fixation biases. This represents a limitation both for the understanding of these forces as well as for the detection of regions affected by selection. Here, we present a new model designed to estimate mutation rates and fixation biases from genetic variation within and between species. We relax the assumption of instantaneous substitutions, modeling substitutions as mutational events followed by a gradual fixation. Hence, we straightforwardly account for shared ancestral polymorphisms and incomplete lineage sorting. We analyze genome-wide synonymous site alignments of human, chimpanzee, and two orangutan species. From each taxon, we include data from several individuals. We estimate mutation rates and GC-biased gene conversion intensity. We find that both mutation rates and biased gene conversion vary with GC content. We also find lineage-specific differences, with weaker fixation biases in orangutan species, suggesting a reduced historical effective population size. Finally, our results are consistent with directional selection acting on coding sequences in relation to exonic splicing enhancers.},

To date, detection of translational selection in vertebrates has proven to be a challenging task, obscured by small long-term effective population sizes in larger animals and the existence of isochores in some species. The consensus is that, in such species, natural selection is either completely ineffective at overcoming mutational pressures and genetic drift or perhaps is effective but so weak that it is not detectable. The aim of this research is to understand the interplay between mutation, selection, and genetic drift in vertebrates. We observe that although variation in mutational bias is undoubtedly the dominant force influencing codon usage, translational selection acts as a weak additional factor influencing synonymous codon usage. These observations indicate that translational selection is a widespread phenomenon in vertebrates and is not limited to a few species.},

Substitutions that are densely clustered on the chromosomes show a remarkable excess of weak-to-strong "biased" substitutions. These unexpected biased clustered substitutions (UBCS) are common near the telomeres of all autosomes but not the sex chromosomes. Regions of extreme bias are enriched for genes. Human and chimp orthologous regions show a striking similarity in the shape and magnitude of their respective UBCS maps, suggesting a relatively stable force leads to clustered bias. The strong and stable signal near telomeres may have participated in the evolution of isochores. One exception to the UBCS pattern found in all autosomes is chromosome 2, which shows a UBCS peak midchromosome, mapping to the fusion site of two ancestral chromosomes. This provides evidence that the fusion occurred as recently as 740,000 years ago and no more than approximately 3 million years ago. No biased clustering was found in SNPs, suggesting that clusters of biased substitutions are selected from mutations. UBCS is strongly correlated with male (and not female) recombination rates, which explains the lack of UBCS signal on chromosome X. These observations support the hypothesis that biased gene conversion (BGC), specifically in the male germline, played a significant role in the evolution of the human genome.},

  abstract = {We compared the exon/intron organization of vertebrate genes belonging to different isochore classes, as predicted by their GC content at third codon position. Two main features have emerged from the analysis of sequences published in GenBank: (1) genes coding for long proteins (i.e., {$>$} or = 500 aa) are almost two times more frequent in GC-poor than in GC-rich isochores; (2) intervening sequences (= sum of introns) are on average three times longer in GC-poor than in GC-rich isochores. These patterns are observed among human, mouse, rat, cow, and even chicken genes and are therefore likely to be common to all warm-blooded vertebrates. Analysis of Xenopus sequences suggests that the same patterns exist in cold-blooded vertebrates. It could be argued that such results do not reflect the reality because sequence databases are not representative of entire genomes. However, analysis of biases in GenBank revealed that the observed discrepancies between GC-rich and GC-poor isochores are not artifactual, and are probably largely underestimated. We investigated the distribution of microsatellites and interspersed repeats in introns of human and mouse genes from different isochores. This analysis confirmed previous studies showing that L1 repeats are almost absent from GC-rich isochores. Microsatellites and SINES (Alu, B1, B2) are found at roughly equal frequencies in introns from all isochore classes. Globally, the presence of repeated sequences does not account for the increased intron length in GC-poor isochores. The relationships between gene structure and global genome organization and evolution are discussed.},

This provides direct evidence for selection on silent sites in those three distantly related multicellular eukaryotes. Surprisingly, there is a strong negative correlation between codon usage and protein length. This effect is not due to a smaller size of highly expressed proteins. Thus, for a same-expression pattern, the selective pressure on codon usage appears to be lower in genes encoding long rather than short proteins. This puzzling observation is not predicted by any of the current models of selection on codon usage and thus raises the question of how translation efficiency affects fitness in multicellular organisms.},

Mutational/neutralist and selectionist models have been put forward to explain their existence. A major criticism of the mutational models is that they cannot account for the higher GC content at fourfold-redundant silent sites within exons (GC4) than in flanking introns (GCi). Indeed, it has been asserted that it is hard to envisage a mutational bias explanation, as it is difficult to see how repair enzymes might act differently in exons and their flanking introns. However, this rejection, we note, ignores the effects of transposable elements (TEs), which are a major component of introns and tend to cause them to have a GC content different from (usually lower than) that dictated by point mutational processes alone. As TEs tend not to insert at the extremities of introns, this model predicts that GC content at the extremities of introns should be more like that at GC4 than are the intronic interiors. This we show to be true. The model also correctly predicts that small introns should have a composition more like that at GC4 than large introns. We conclude that the logic of the previous rejection of neutralist models is unsafe.},

  abstract = {To understand the origin and evolution of isochores-the peculiar spatial distribution of GC content within mammalian genomes-we analyzed the synonymous substitution pattern in coding sequences from closely related species in different mammalian orders. In primate and cetartiodactyls, GC-rich genes are undergoing a large excess of GC --{$>$} AT substitutions over AT --{$>$} GC substitutions: GC-rich isochores are slowly disappearing from the genome of these two mammalian orders. In rodents, our analyses suggest both a decrease in GC content of GC-rich isochores and an increase in GC-poor isochores, but more data will be necessary to assess the significance of this pattern. These observations question the conclusions of previous works that assumed that base composition was at equilibrium. Analysis of allele frequency in human polymorphism data, however, confirmed that in the GC-rich parts of the genome, GC alleles have a higher probability of fixation than AT alleles. This fixation bias appears not strong enough to overcome the large excess of GC --{$>$} AT mutations. Thus, whatever the evolutionary force (neutral or selective) at the origin of GC-rich isochores, this force is no longer effective in mammals. We propose a model based on the biased gene conversion hypothesis that accounts for the origin of GC-rich isochores in the ancestral amniote genome and for their decline in present-day mammals.},

The origin of isochores is still controversial: various neutral and selectionist models have been proposed \textendash{} and criticized \textendash{} since the discovery of isochores in the 1970s. The availability of complete mammalian genomes has yielded new opportunities for addressing this question. In particular, it was recently proposed that (i) the isochore structure is declining in many mammalian groups, and that (ii) GC-content is influenced by local recombination rate, possibly via the mechanism of GC-biased gene conversion. In this article we review the existing support for these two hypotheses, and discuss how they can be combined to provide a new perspective on isochore evolution.},

Diploid but silent micronuclei transmit the genetic information to the next sexual generation. Polyploid macronuclei express the genetic information from a streamlined version of the genome but are replaced at each sexual generation. The macronuclear genome of Paramecium tetraurelia was recently sequenced by a shotgun approach, providing access to the gene repertoire. The 72-Mb assembly represents a consensus sequence for the somatic DNA, which is produced after sexual events by reproducible rearrangements of the zygotic genome involving elimination of repeated sequences, precise excision of unique-copy internal eliminated sequences (IES), and amplification of the cellular genes to high copy number. We report use of the shotgun sequencing data ({$>$}10(6) reads representing 13 x coverage of a completely homozygous clone) to evaluate variability in the somatic DNA produced by these developmental genome rearrangements. Although DNA amplification appears uniform, both of the DNA elimination processes produce sequence heterogeneity. The variability that arises from IES excision allowed identification of hundreds of putative new IESs, compared to 42 that were previously known, and revealed cases of erroneous excision of segments of coding sequences. We demonstrate that IESs in coding regions are under selective pressure to introduce premature termination of translation in case of excision failure.},

  abstract = {Unraveling the evolutionary forces responsible for variations of neutral substitution patterns among taxa or along genomes is a major issue for detecting selection within sequences. Mammalian genomes show large-scale regional variations of GC-content (the isochores), but the substitution processes at the origin of this structure are poorly understood. We analyzed the pattern of neutral substitutions in 1 Gb of primate non-coding regions. We show that the GC-content toward which sequences are evolving is strongly negatively correlated to the distance to telomeres and positively correlated to the rate of crossovers (R2 = 47\%). This demonstrates that recombination has a major impact on substitution patterns in human, driving the evolution of GC-content. The evolution of GC-content correlates much more strongly with male than with female crossover rate, which rules out selectionist models for the evolution of isochores. This effect of recombination is most probably a consequence of the neutral process of biased gene conversion (BGC) occurring within recombination hotspots. We show that the predictions of this model fit very well with the observed substitution patterns in the human genome. This model notably explains the positive correlation between substitution rate and recombination rate. Theoretical calculations indicate that variations in population size or density in recombination hotspots can have a very strong impact on the evolution of base composition. Furthermore, recombination hotspots can create strong substitution hotspots. This molecular drive affects both coding and non-coding regions. We therefore conclude that along with mutation, selection and drift, BGC is one of the major factors driving genome evolution. Our results also shed light on variations in the rate of crossover relative to non-crossover events, along chromosomes and according to sex, and also on the conservation of hotspot density between human and chimp.},

  abstract = {Recombination is typically thought of as a symmetrical process resulting in large-scale reciprocal genetic exchanges between homologous chromosomes. Recombination events, however, are also accompanied by short-scale, unidirectional exchanges known as gene conversion in the neighborhood of the initiating double-strand break. A large body of evidence suggests that gene conversion is GC-biased in many eukaryotes, including mammals and human. AT/GC heterozygotes produce more GC- than AT-gametes, thus conferring a population advantage to GC-alleles in high-recombining regions. This apparently unimportant feature of our molecular machinery has major evolutionary consequences. Structurally, GC-biased gene conversion explains the spatial distribution of GC-content in mammalian genomes-the so-called isochore structure. Functionally, GC-biased gene conversion promotes the segregation and fixation of deleterious AT --{$>$} GC mutations, thus increasing our genomic mutation load. Here we review the recent evidence for a GC-biased gene conversion process in mammals, and its consequences for genomic landscapes, molecular evolution, and human functional genomics.},

Under conservative assumptions, we estimate that an average of 4.2 amino-acid-altering mutations per diploid per generation have occurred in the human lineage since humans separated from chimpanzees. Of these mutations, we estimate that at least 38\% have been eliminated by natural selection, indicating that there have been more than 1.6 new deleterious mutations per diploid genome per generation. Thus, the deleterious mutation rate specific to protein-coding sequences alone is close to the upper limit tolerable by a species such as humans that has a low reproductive rate, indicating that the effects of deleterious mutations may have combined synergistically. Furthermore, the level of selective constraint in hominid protein-coding sequences is atypically low. A large number of slightly deleterious mutations may therefore have become fixed in hominid lineages.},

Surprisingly, the first fully sequenced nonavian sauropsid (i.e., reptile), the green anole Anolis carolinensis, revealed a highly homogeneous genomic GC-content landscape, suggesting the possibility that gBGC might not be at work in this lineage. Here, we analyze GC-content evolution at third-codon positions (GC3) in 44 vertebrates species, including eight newly sequenced transcriptomes, with a specific focus on nonavian sauropsids. We report that reptiles, including the green anole, have a genome-wide distribution of GC3 similar to that of mammals and birds, and we infer a strong GC3-heterogeneity to be already present in the tetrapod ancestor. We further show that the dynamic of coding sequence GC-content is largely governed by karyotypic features in vertebrates, notably in the green anole, in agreement with the gBGC hypothesis. The discrepancy between third-codon positions and noncoding DNA regarding GC-content dynamics in the green anole could not be explained by the activity of transposable elements or selection on codon usage. This analysis highlights the unique value of third-codon positions as an insertion/deletion-free marker of nucleotide substitution biases that ultimately affect the evolution of proteins.},

Analysis of human DNA sequence data confirms that this is the case for 5-methylcytosine. Several lines of evidence further confirm that it is also the case for unmethylated cytosine and that cytosine deamination causes the majority of all C--{$>$}T and G--{$>$}A transitions in mammals. Thus, cytosine deamination and DNA base composition each affect the other, forming a positive feedback loop that facilitates divergent genetic drift to high or low GC content. Because a 10 degrees C increase in temperature in vitro increases the rate of cytosine deamination 5. 7-fold, cytosine deamination must be highly dependent on body temperature, which is consistent with the dramatic differences between the isochores of warm-blooded versus cold-blooded vertebrates. Because this process involves both DNA melting and positive feedback, it would be expected to spread progressively (in evolutionary time) down the length of the chromosome, which is consistent with the large size of isochores in modern mammals.},

Third codon position GC content, however, is influenced by both neutral forces (e.g., mutation bias) and natural selection for codon usage optimization. In this article, large data sets of noncoding DNA sequence polymorphism in D. melanogaster and D. simulans were gathered from public databases to try to disentangle these two factors-noncoding sequences are not affected by selection for codon usage. Allele frequency analyses revealed an asymmetric pattern of AT vs. GC noncoding polymorphisms: AT --{$>$} GC mutations are less numerous, and tend to segregate at a higher frequency, than GC --{$>$} AT ones, especially at GC-rich loci. This is indicative of nonstationary evolution of base composition and/or of GC-biased allele transmission. Fitting population genetics models to the allele frequency spectra confirmed this result and favored the hypothesis of a biased transmission. These results, together with previous reports, suggest that GC-biased gene conversion has influenced base composition evolution in Drosophila and explain the correlation between intron and exon GC content.},

Sequences contributing to species adaptation are expected to evolve faster than nonfunctional sequences because favourable mutations have a higher fixation probability than neutral ones. Such an accelerated rate of evolution might be due to factors other than natural selection, in particular GC-biased gene conversion. This is true of neutral sequences, but also of constrained sequences, which can be illustrated using the mouse Fxy gene. Several criteria can discriminate between the natural selection and biased gene conversion models. These criteria suggest that the recently reported human accelerated regions are most likely the result of biased gene conversion.

Whether codon usage is also generally shaped by natural selection in large organisms, despite their relatively small effective population size (Ne), is unclear. In animals, the population genetics of codon usage bias has only been studied in a handful of model organisms so far, and can be affected by confounding, nonadaptive processes such as GC-biased gene conversion and experimental artefacts. Using population transcriptomics data, we analyzed the relationship between codon usage, gene expression, allele frequency distribution, and recombination rate in 30 nonmodel species of animals, each from a different family, covering a wide range of effective population sizes. We disentangled the effects of translational selection and GC-biased gene conversion on codon usage by separately analyzing GC-conservative and GC-changing mutations. We report evidence for effective translational selection on codon usage in large-Ne species of animals, but not in small-Ne ones, in agreement with the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution. C- and T-ending codons tend to be preferred over synonymous G- and A-ending ones, for reasons that remain to be determined. In contrast, we uncovered a conspicuous effect of GC-biased gene conversion, which is widespread in animals and the main force determining the fate of AT{$\leftrightarrow$}GC mutations. Intriguingly, the strength of its effect was uncorrelated with Ne.},

  abstract = {Patterns of genetic differentiation among taxa at early stages of divergence provide an opportunity to make inferences about the history of speciation. Here, we conduct a survey of DNA-sequence polymorphism and divergence at loci on the autosomes, X chromosome, Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA in samples of Mus domesticus, M. musculus and M. castaneus. We analyzed our data under a divergence with gene flow model and estimate that the effective population size of M. castaneus is 200,000-400,000, of M. domesticus is 100,000-200,000 and of M. musculus is 60,000-120,000. These data also suggest that these species started to diverge approximately 500,000 years ago. Consistent with this recent divergence, we observed considerable variation in the genealogical patterns among loci. For some loci, all alleles within each species formed a monophyletic group, while at other loci, species were intermingled on the phylogeny of alleles. This intermingling probably reflects both incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow after divergence. Likelihood ratio tests rejected a strict allopatric model with no gene flow in comparisons between each pair of species. Gene flow was asymmetric: no gene flow was detected into M. domesticus, while significant gene flow was detected into both M. castaneus and M. musculus. Finally, most of the gene flow occurred at autosomal loci, resulting in a significantly higher ratio of fixed differences to polymorphisms at the X and Y chromosomes relative to autosomes in some comparisons, or just the X chromosome in others, emphasizing the important role of the sex chromosomes in general and the X chromosome in particular in speciation.},

  abstract = {A fundamental challenge in population genetics and molecular evolution is to understand the forces shaping the patterns of genetic diversity within and among species. Among them, mating systems are thought to have important influences on molecular diversity and genome evolution. Selfing is expected to reduce effective population size, Ne, and effective recombination rates, directly leading to reduced polymorphism and increased linkage disequilibrium compared with outcrossing. Increased isolation between populations also results directly from selfing or indirectly from evolutionary changes, such as small flowers and low pollen output, leading to greater differentiation of molecular markers than under outcrossing. The lower effective recombination rate increases the likelihood of hitch-hiking, further reducing within-deme diversity of selfers and thus increasing their genetic differentiation. There are also indirect effects on molecular evolutionary processes. Low Ne reduces the efficacy of selection; in selfers, selection should thus be less efficient in removing deleterious mutations. The rarity of heterozygous sites in selfers leads to infrequent action of biased conversion towards GC, which tends to increase sequences' GC content in the most highly recombining genome regions of outcrossers. To test these predictions in plants, we used a newly developed sequence polymorphism database to investigate the effects of mating system differences on sequence polymorphism and genome evolution in a wide set of plant species. We also took into account other life-history traits, including life form (whether annual or perennial herbs, and woody perennial) and the modes of pollination and seed dispersal, which are known to affect enzyme and DNA marker polymorphism. We show that among various life-history traits, mating systems have the greatest influence on patterns of polymorphism.},

  abstract = {GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) is a recombination-associated process mimicking selection in favor of G and C alleles. It is increasingly recognized as a widespread force in shaping the genomic nucleotide landscape. In recombination hotspots, gBGC can lead to bursts of fixation of GC nucleotides and to accelerated nucleotide substitution rates. It was recently shown that these episodes of strong gBGC could give spurious signatures of adaptation and/or relaxed selection. There is also evidence that gBGC could drive the fixation of deleterious amino acid mutations in some primate genes. This raises the question of the potential fitness effects of gBGC. While gBGC has been metaphorically termed the ``Achilles' heel'' of our genome, we do not know whether interference between gBGC and selection merely has practical consequences for the analysis of sequence data or whether it has broader fundamental implications for individuals and populations. I developed a population genetics model to predict the consequences of gBGC on the mutation load and inbreeding depression. I also used estimates available for humans to quantitatively evaluate the fitness impact of gBGC. Surprising features emerged from this model: (i) Contrary to classical mutation load models, gBGC generates a fixation load independent of population size and could contribute to a significant part of the load; (ii) gBGC can maintain recessive deleterious mutations for a long time at intermediate frequency, in a similar way to overdominance, and these mutations generate high inbreeding depression, even if they are slightly deleterious; (iii) since mating systems affect both the selection efficacy and gBGC intensity, gBGC challenges classical predictions concerning the interaction between mating systems and deleterious mutations, and gBGC could constitute an additional cost of outcrossing; and (iv) if mutations are biased toward A and T alleles, very low gBGC levels can reduce the load. A robust prediction is that the gBGC level minimizing the load depends only on the mutational bias and population size. These surprising results suggest that gBGC may have nonnegligible fitness consequences and could play a significant role in the evolution of genetic systems. They also shed light on the evolution of gBGC itself.},

  abstract = {Much evidence indicates that GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) has a major impact on the evolution of mammalian genomes. However, a detailed quantification of the process is still lacking. The strength of gBGC can be measured from the analysis of derived allele frequency spectra (DAF), but this approach is sensitive to a number of confounding factors. In particular, we show by simulations that the inference is pervasively affected by polymorphism polarization errors and by spatial heterogeneity in gBGC strength. We propose a new general method to quantify gBGC from DAF spectra, incorporating polarization errors, taking spatial heterogeneity into account, and jointly estimating mutation bias. Applying it to human polymorphism data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that the strength of gBGC does not differ between hypermutable CpG sites and non-CpG sites, suggesting that in humans gBGC is not caused by the base-excision repair machinery. Genome-wide, the intensity of gBGC is in the nearly neutral area. However, given that recombination occurs primarily within recombination hotspots, 1\%-2\% of the human genome is subject to strong gBGC. On average, gBGC is stronger in African than in non-African populations, reflecting differences in effective population sizes. However, due to more heterogeneous recombination landscapes, the fraction of the genome affected by strong gBGC is larger in non-African than in African populations. Given that the location of recombination hotspots evolves very rapidly, our analysis predicts that, in the long term, a large fraction of the genome is affected by short episodes of strong gBGC.},

A unique gene tree was constructed from 326 sequences of 349 in the total sample. New maximum-likelihood methods for analyzing gene trees on the basis of coalescence theory have been used. The most recent common ancestor of the beta-globin gene tree is a sequence found only in Africa and estimated to have arisen approximately 800,000 years ago. There is no evidence for an exponential expansion out of a bottlenecked founding population, and an effective population size of approximately 10,000 has been maintained. Modest differences in levels of beta-globin diversity between Africa and Asia are better explained by greater African effective population size than by greater time depth. There may have been a reduction of Asian effective population size in recent evolutionary history. Characteristically Asian ancestry is estimated to be older than 200,000 years, suggesting that the ancestral hominid population at this time was widely dispersed across Africa and Asia. Patterns of beta-globin diversity suggest extensive worldwide late Pleistocene gene flow and are not easily reconciled with a unidirectional migration out of Africa 100,000 years ago and total replacement of archaic populations in Asia.},

We obtain estimates of the strength of gBGC acting on synonymous sites in five species of yeast, which we find to be a much weaker force than selection. We use this to correct estimates of the strength of selection on codon usage bias, which are normally confounded by the action of gBGC. Our estimate of the rate of gBGC agrees well with an experimentally determined value obtained from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also find that, contrary to expectation, codon usage bias is highest in areas of intermediate levels of recombination for GC-ending optimal codons. Possible reasons for this are discussed.},

  abstract = {Mating systems and recombination are thought to have a deep impact on the organization and evolution of genomes. Because of the decline in effective population size and the interference between linked loci, the efficacy of selection is expected to be reduced in regions with low recombination rates and in the whole genome of self-fertilizing species. At the molecular level, relaxed selection is expected to result in changes in the rate of protein evolution and the pattern of codon bias. It is increasingly recognized that recombination also affects non-selective processes such as the biased gene conversion towards GC alleles (bGC). Like selection, this kind of meiotic drive in favour of GC over AT alleles is expected to be reduced in weakly recombining regions and genomes. Here, we investigated the effect of mating system and recombination on molecular evolution in four Triticeae species: two outcrossers (Secale cereale and Aegilops speltoides) and two selfers (Triticum urartu and Triticum monococcum). We found that GC content, possibly driven by bGC, is affected by mating system and recombination as theoretically predicted. Selection efficacy, however, is only weakly affected by mating system and recombination. We investigated the possible reasons for this discrepancy. A surprising one is that, in outcrossing lineages, selection efficacy could be reduced because of high substitution rates in favour of GC alleles. Outcrossers, but not selfers, would thus suffer from a 'GC-induced' genetic load. This result sheds new light on the evolution of mating systems.},

Here, we study this question by identifying for the first time the favored codons in 675 bacteria, 52 archea, and 10 fungi. We use a number of tests to show that the identified codons are indeed likely to be favored and find that across all studied organisms the identity of favored codons tracks the GC content of the genomes. Once the effect of the genomic GC content on selectively favored codon choice is taken into account, additional universal amino acid specific rules governing the identity of favored codons become apparent. Our results provide for the first time a clear set of rules governing the evolution of selectively favored codon usage. Based on these results, we describe a putative scenario for how evolutionary shifts in the identity of selectively favored codons can occur without even temporary weakening of natural selection for codon bias.},

Thus codon bias is an indicator of the intensity of one kind of selection that is experienced by genes and can be used to assess the impact of other genomic factors on natural selection. Among 13,000 genes in the Drosophila genome, codon bias has a slight positive, and strongly significant, association with recombination--as expected if recombination allows natural selection to act more efficiently when multiple linked sites segregate functional variation. The same reasoning leads to the expectation that the efficiency of selection, and thus average codon bias, should decline with gene density. However, this prediction is not confirmed. Levels of codon bias and gene expression are highest for those genes in an intermediate range of gene density, a pattern that may be the result of a tradeoff between the advantages for gene expression of close gene spacing and disadvantages arising from regulatory conflicts among tightly packed genes. These factors appear to overlay the more subtle effect of linkage among selected sites that gives rise to the association between recombination rate and codon bias.},

Mouse MHC genes which have been suspected but not directly implied to be involved in gene conversion events also showed elevated levels of CpG dinucleotides. Moreover, both mouse and human MHC genes which have never been suspected of undergoing gene conversion had low levels of CpG throughout the genes. These results indicate that high CpG levels are correlated with gene conversion rather than with polymorphism, as non-polymorphic genes that have been implicated as gene conversion donors also have elevated levels of CpG dimers in the involved regions, whereas polymorphic genes which have never been considered to undergo gene conversion events have a low level of CpG dinucleotides. We also studied the methylation pattern of CpG dimers in the Abk gene by restriction enzyme digestion of mouse testis DNA followed by Southern blot and hybridization to an Abk-specific probe. The examined CpG dimers in prepubescent mice, where the latest germline stages are spermatogonia, leptene, or pachytene, are respectively non-methylated.

Five different flavors of euchromatic metaphase bands are cytologically identified along a human ideogram. These are G-bands and, based upon combinations of extreme Alu richness and GC richness, four different R-band flavors. The two flavors with extremely GC-rich components, traditionally called "T-bands," represent only 15\% of all bands. However, they contain 65\% of mapped genes, 19 of 25 mapped oncogenes, most cancer-associated rearrangements, evolutionary rearrangements, meiotic chiasmata, and X-ray-induced breaks. Flavors with extremely Alu-rich flavors are also involved in melphalan-induced rearrangements, pachytene stretching, and mitotic chiasmata. Frequencies of CpG islands, CCGCCC boxes, retroposon families, and genes are characteristic to each chromatin flavor and will facilitate alignment of genome sequences onto ideograms of chromatin flavor. The influence of chromatin flavor on the evolution of a gene's sequence is so strong that one can infer the flavor of the band in which a gene resides from the sequence of the gene itself. Correlation coefficients for many pairs of mapped genetic variables, while globally high, are quite low within bands of one flavor, implicating a concerted mode of evolution for bands of one chromatin flavor.},

This unexpected evolutionary signature is suggestive of deeply conserved function that was lost or changed on the human lineage. Since their discovery, the actual roles of HARs in human evolution have remained somewhat elusive, due to their being almost exclusively non-coding sequences with no annotation. Ongoing research is beginning to crack this problem by leveraging new genome sequences, functional genomics data, computational approaches, and genetic assays to reveal that many HARs are developmental gene regulatory elements and RNA genes, most of which evolved their uniquely human mutations through positive selection before divergence of archaic hominins and diversification of modern humans.},

  abstract = {The genomes of warm-blooded vertebrates are characterized by a strong heterogeneity in base composition, with GC-rich and GC-poor isochores. The GC content of sequences, especially in third codon positions, is highly correlated with that of the isochore they are embedded in. In amphibian and fish genomes, GC-rich isochores are nearly absent. Thus, it has been proposed that the GC increase in a part of mammalian and avian genomes represents an adaptation to homeothermy. To test this selective hypothesis, we sequenced marker protein genes in two cold-blooded vertebrates, the Nile crocodile Crocodylus niloticus (10 genes) and the red-eared slider Trachemys scripta elegans (6 genes). The analysis of base composition in third codon position of this original data set shows that the Nile crocodile and the turtle also exhibit GC-rich isochores, which rules out the homeothermy hypothesis. Instead, we propose that the GC increase results from a mutational bias that took place earlier than the adaptation to homeothermy in birds and before the turtle/crocodile divergence. Surprisingly, the isochore structure appears very similar between the red-eared slider and the Nile crocodile than between the chicken and the Nile crocodile. This point questions the phylogenetic position of turtles as a basal lineage of extant reptiles. We also observed a regular molecular clock in the Archosauria, which enables us, by using a more extended data set, to confirm Kumar and Hedges's dating of the bird-crocodile split.},

For example, the evolutionary distance between chicken and human provides high specificity in detecting functional elements, both non-coding and coding.

  abstract = {Four-fold degenerate coding sites form a major component of the genome, and are often used to make inferences about selection and demography, so that understanding their evolution is important. Despite previous efforts, many questions regarding the causes of base composition changes at these sites in Drosophila remain unanswered. To shed further light on this issue, we obtained a new whole-genome polymorphism data set from D. simulans. We analyzed samples from the putatively ancestral range of D. simulans, as well as an existing polymorphism data set from an African population of D. melanogaster. By using D. yakuba as an outgroup, we found clear evidence for selection on 4-fold sites along both lineages over a substantial period, with the intensity of selection increasing with GC content. Based on an explicit model of base composition evolution, we suggest that the observed AT-biased substitution pattern in both lineages is probably due to an ancestral reduction in selection intensity, and is unlikely to be the result of an increase in mutational bias towards AT alone. By using two polymorphism-based methods for estimating selection coefficients over different timescales, we show that the selection intensity on codon usage has been rather stable in D. simulans in the recent past, but the long-term estimates in D. melanogaster are much higher than the short-term ones, indicating a continuing decline in selection intensity, to such an extent that the short-term estimates suggest that selection is only active in the most GC-rich parts of the genome. Finally, we provide evidence for complex evolutionary patterns in the putatively neutral short introns, which cannot be explained by the standard GC-biased gene conversion model. These results reveal a dynamic picture of base composition evolution.},

We show that faster evolving genes encode significantly more membrane or excreted proteins, consistent with the notion that selection acts on cell surface modifications that is driven by selection for resistance to viruses and grazers, keystone actors of phytoplankton evolution. The relationship between GC content and chromosome length also suggests that both strains have experienced recombination since their divergence and that lack of recombination on the two outlier chromosomes could explain part of their peculiar genomic features, including higher rates of evolution.},

These findings, which are paralleled by the compositional similarity of homologous coding sequences and their codon positions, support the idea that birds are a monophyletic group.The compositional distribution of third-codon positions of genes from chicken, the only avian species for which a relatively large number of coding sequences is known, is very broad and bimodal, the minor GC-richer peak reaching 100\% GC. The very high compositional heterogeneity of avian genomes is accompanied (as in the case of mammalian genomes) by a very high speciation rate compared to cold-blooded vertebrates which are characterized by genomes that are much less heterogeneous. The higher GC levels attained by avian compared to mammalian genomes might be correlated with the higher body temperature (41\textendash{}43\textdegree{}C) of birds compared to mammals (37\textdegree{}C).A comparison of GC levels of coding sequences and codon positions from man and chicken revealed very close average GC levels and standard deviations. Homologous coding sequences and codon positions from man and chicken showed a surprisingly high degree of compositional similarity which was, however, higher for GC-poor than for GC-rich sequences. This indicates that GC-poor isochores of warm-blooded vertebrates reflect the composition of the isochores of the genome of the common reptilian ancestor of mammals and birds, which underwent only a small compositional change at the transition from cold- to warm-blooded vertebrates. In contrast, the GC-rich isochores of birds and mammals are the result of large compositional changes at the same evolutionary transition, where were in part different in the two classes of warm-blooded vertebrates.},

We used high throughput sequencing combined with methods to enrich human genomic samples for particular targets to obtain the sequence of 22 chromosomal samples at high depth in 40 kb neighborhoods of 49 previously identified 100\textendash{}400 bp elements that show evidence for human accelerated evolution. In addition to selection, the pattern of nucleotide substitutions in several of these elements suggested an historical bias favoring the conversion of weak (A or T) alleles into strong (G or C) alleles. Here we found strong evidence in the derived allele frequency spectra of many of these 40 kb regions for ongoing weak-to-strong fixation bias. Comparison of the nucleotide composition at polymorphic loci to the composition at sites of fixed substitutions additionally reveals the signature of historical weak-to-strong fixation bias in a subset of these regions. Most of the regions with evidence for historical bias do not also have signatures of ongoing bias, suggesting that the evolutionary forces generating weak-to-strong bias are not constant over time. To investigate the role of selection in shaping these regions, we analyzed the spatial pattern of polymorphism in our samples. We found no significant evidence for selective sweeps, possibly because the signal of such sweeps has decayed beyond the power of our tests to detect them. Together, these results do not rule out functional roles for the observed changes in these regions\textemdash{}indeed there is good evidence that the first two are functional elements in humans\textemdash{}but they suggest that a fixation process (such as biased gene conversion) that is biased at the nucleotide level, but is otherwise selectively neutral, could be an important evolutionary force at play in them, both historically and at present.},

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not share this pattern, suggesting that it results from biased fixation rather than biased mutation. Supporting this hypothesis, analyses of polymorphism in specific regions of the human genome have identified a positive correlation between weak to strong (W\textrightarrow{}S) SNPs and derived allele frequency (DAF), suggesting that SNPs become increasingly GC biased over time, especially in regions of high recombination. Using polymorphism data generated by the 1000 Genomes Project from 179 individuals from 4 human populations, we evaluated the extent and distribution of ongoing GC-biased evolution in the human genome. We quantified GC fixation bias by comparing the DAFs of W\textrightarrow{}S mutations and S\textrightarrow{}W mutations using a Mann\textendash{}Whitney U test. Genome-wide, W\textrightarrow{}S SNPs have significantly higher DAFs than S\textrightarrow{}W SNPs. This pattern is widespread across the human genome but varies in magnitude along the chromosomes. We found extreme GC-biased evolution in neighborhoods of recombination hot spots, a significant correlation between GC bias and recombination rate, and an inverse correlation between GC bias and chromosome arm length. These findings demonstrate the presence of ongoing fixation bias favoring G and C alleles throughout the human genome and suggest that the bias is caused by a recombination-associated process, such as GC-biased gene conversion.},

Here, we provide a genome-wide analysis of the rate and spectrum of mutations obtained in two Daphnia pulex genotypes via separate mutation-accumulation (MA) experiments. Unlike most MA studies that utilize haploid, homozygous, or self-fertilizing lines, D. pulex can be propagated ameiotically while maintaining a naturally heterozygous, diploid genome, allowing the capture of the full spectrum of genomic changes that arise in a heterozygous state. While base-substitution mutation rates are similar to those in other multicellular eukaryotes (about 4 \texttimes{} 10-9 per site per generation), we find that the rates of large-scale ({$>$}100 kb) de novo copy-number variants (CNVs) are significantly elevated relative to those seen in previous MA studies. The heterozygosity maintained in this experiment allowed for estimates of gene-conversion processes. While most of the conversion tract lengths we report are similar to those generated by meiotic processes, we also find larger tract lengths that are indicative of mitotic processes. Comparison of MA lines to natural isolates reveals that a majority of large-scale CNVs in natural populations are removed by purifying selection. The mutations observed here share similarities with disease-causing, complex, large-scale CNVs, thereby demonstrating that MA studies in D. pulex serve as a system for studying the processes leading to such alterations.},

  abstract = {The rise of insect societies, marked by the formation of reproductive and sterile castes, represents a major unsolved mystery in evolution. Across several independent origins of sociality, the genomes of social hymenopterans share two peculiar attributes: high recombination and low but heterogeneous GC content. For example, the genome of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, represents a mosaic of GC-poor and GC-rich regions with rates of recombination an order of magnitude higher than in humans. However, it is unclear how heterogeneity in GC content arises, and how it relates to the expression and evolution of worker traits. Using population genetic analyses, we demonstrate a bias in the allele frequency and fixation rate of derived C or G mutations in high-recombination regions, consistent with recombination's causal influence on GC-content evolution via biased gene conversion. We also show that recombination and biased gene conversion actively maintain the heterogeneous GC content of the honey bee genome despite an overall A/T mutation bias. Further, we found that GC-rich genes and intergenic regions have higher levels of genetic diversity and divergence relative to GC-poor regions, also consistent with recombination's causal influence on the rate of molecular evolution. Finally, we found that genes associated with behavior and those with worker-biased expression are found in GC-rich regions of the bee genome and also experience high rates of molecular evolution. Taken together, these findings suggest that recombination acts to maintain a genetically diverse and dynamic part of the genome where genes underlying worker behavior evolve more quickly.},

They are generally nonfunctional after their insertion and, as a consequence, are no longer subjected to the selective constraints associated with functional genes. Because of this property they can be used as neutral markers in molecular evolution. In this work, we investigated the relationship between the evolution of GC content in recently inserted processed pseudogenes and the local recombination pattern in two mammalian genomes (human and mouse). We confirmed, using original markers, that recombination drives GC content in the human genome and we demonstrated that this is also true for the mouse genome despite lower recombination rates. Finally, we discussed the consequences on isochores evolution and the contrast between the human and the mouse pattern.},

  abstract = {Synonymous codons are not used equally in many organisms, and the extent of codon bias varies among loci. Earlier studies have suggested that more highly expressed loci in Drosophila melanogaster are more biased, consistent with findings from several prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes that codon bias is partly due to natural selection for translational efficiency. We link this model of varying selection intensity to the population-genetics prediction that the effectiveness of natural selection is decreased under reduced recombination. In analyses of 385 D. melanogaster loci, we find that codon bias is reduced in regions of low recombination (i.e., near centromeres and telomeres and on the fourth chromosome). The effect does not appear to be a linear function of recombination rate; rather, it seems limited to regions with the very lowest levels of recombination. The large majority of the genome apparently experiences recombination at a sufficiently high rate for effective natural selection against suboptimal codons. These findings support models of the Hill-Robertson effect and genetic hitchhiking and are largely consistent with multiple reports of low levels of DNA sequence variation in regions of low recombination.},

We report that the sequences of HSPA1A and HSPA1B genes are almost identical, whereas the HSPA1L gene contains some regions very similar to HSPA1A/B and some regions with much higher divergence. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that gene conversion has homogenized the entire coding regions of HSPA1A/B and several fragments of HSPA1L. The regions undergoing conversion are all very GC rich, contrarily to the regions not subject to conversion. The pattern of nucleotide substitution in mammalian orthologs suggests that the mechanism increasing the GC content is still functioning. To test the possibility that the high GC content facilitates the expression of Hsp70 during heat-shock, we performed in vitro translation experiments. We failed to detect any effect of GC content on the translation efficiency at high temperatures. Taken together, our data strongly support the biased gene conversion hypothesis of GC-content evolution.},

Especially in chicken, microchromosomes exhibit a higher GC-content and a higher gene density than macrochromosomes. To understand the evolutionary history of the intra-genome GC heterogeneity in amniotes, it is necessary to examine the equivalence of this GC heterogeneity at the nucleotide level between these animals including reptiles, from which birds diverged. We isolated cDNAs for 39 protein-coding genes from the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, Pelodiscus sinensis, and performed chromosome mapping of 31 genes. The GC-content of exonic third positions (GC3) of P. sinensis genes showed a heterogeneous distribution, and exhibited a significant positive correlation with that of chicken and human orthologs, indicating that the last common ancestor of extant amniotes had already established a GC-compartmentalized genomic structure. Furthermore, chromosome mapping in P. sinensis revealed that microchromosomes tend to contain more GC-rich genes than GC-poor genes, as in chicken. These results illustrate two modes of genome evolution in amniotes: mammals elaborated the genomic configuration in which GC-rich and GC-poor regions coexist in individual chromosomes, whereas sauropsids (reptiles and birds) refined the chromosomal size-dependent GC compartmentalization in which GC-rich genomic fractions tend to be confined to microchromosomes.},

  abstract = {Gene conversion results in the nonreciprocal transfer of genetic information between two recombining sequences, and there is evidence that this process is biased toward G and C alleles. However, the strength of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) in human populations and its effects on hereditary disease have yet to be assessed on a genomic scale. Using high-coverage whole-genome sequences of African hunter-gatherers, agricultural populations, and primate outgroups, we quantified the effects of GC-biased gene conversion on population genomic data sets. We find that genetic distances (FST and population branch statistics) are modified by gBGC. In addition, the site frequency spectrum is left-shifted when ancestral alleles are favored by gBGC and right-shifted when derived alleles are favored by gBGC. Allele frequency shifts due to gBGC mimic the effects of natural selection. As expected, these effects are strongest in high-recombination regions of the human genome. By comparing the relative rates of fixation of unbiased and biased sites, the strength of gene conversion was estimated to be on the order of Nb {$\approx$} 0.05 to 0.09. We also find that derived alleles favored by gBGC are much more likely to be homozygous than derived alleles at unbiased SNPs (+42.2\% to 62.8\%). This results in a curse of the converted, whereby gBGC causes substantial increases in hereditary disease risks. Taken together, our findings reveal that GC-biased gene conversion has important population genetic and public health implications.},

  abstract = {The pattern of codon usage in the amitochondriate diplomonad Giardia lamblia has been investigated. Very extensive heterogeneity was evident among a sample of 65 genes. A discrete group of genes featured unusual codon usage due to the amino acid composition of their products: these variant surface proteins (VSPs) are unusually rich in Cys and, to a lesser extent, Gly and Thr. Among the remaining 50 genes, correspondence analysis revealed a single major source of variation in synonymous codon usage. This trend was related to the extent of use of a particular subset of 21 codons which are inferred to be those which are optimal for translation; at one end of this trend were genes expected to be expressed at low levels with near random codon usage, while at the other extreme were genes expressed at high levels in which these optimal codons are used almost exclusively. These optimal codons all end in C or G so G + C content at silent sites varies enormously among genes, from values around 40\%, expected to reflect the background level of the genome, up to nearly 100\%. Although VSP genes are occasionally extremely highly expressed, they do not, in general, have high frequencies of optimal codons, presumably because their high expression is only intermittent. These results indicate that natural selection has been very effective in shaping codon usage in G. lamblia. These analyses focused on sequences from strains placed within G. lamblia "assemblage A"; a few sequences from other strains revealed extensive divergence at silent sites, including some divergence in the pattern of codon usage.},

Furthermore, owing to its dependence on the local recombination rate, gBGC results in modulations of the substitution patterns along genomes and across time which, if correctly interpreted, may yield quantitative insights into the long-term evolutionary dynamics of recombination landscapes. Deriving a model of the substitution process at putatively neutral nucleotide positions from population-genetics arguments, and accounting for among-lineage and among-gene effects, we propose a reconstruction of the variation in gBGC intensity at the scale of placental mammals, and of its scaling with body-size and karyotypic traits. Our results are compatible with a simple population genetics model relating gBGC to effective population size and recombination rate. In addition, among-gene variation and phylogenetic patterns of exon-specific levels of gBGC reveal the presence of rugged recombination landscapes, and suggest that short-lived recombination hot-spots are a general feature of placentals. Across placental mammals, variation in gBGC strength spans two orders of magnitude, at its lowest in apes, strongest in lagomorphs, microbats or tenrecs, and near or above the nearly neutral threshold in most other lineages. Combined with among-gene variation, such high levels of biased gene conversion are likely to significantly impact midly selected positions, and to represent a substantial mutation load. Altogether, our analysis suggests a more important role of gBGC in placental genome evolution, compared with what could have been anticipated from studies conducted in anthropoid primates.},

  abstract = {The characterization of functional elements in genomes relies on the identification of the footprints of natural selection. In this quest, taking into account neutral evolutionary processes such as mutation and genetic drift is crucial because these forces can generate patterns that may obscure or mimic signatures of selection. In mammals, and probably in many eukaryotes, another such confounding factor called GC-Biased Gene Conversion (gBGC) has been documented. This mechanism generates patterns identical to what is expected under selection for higher GC-content, specifically in highly recombining genomic regions. Recent results have suggested that a mysterious selective force favouring higher GC-content exists in Bacteria but the possibility that it could be gBGC has been excluded. Here, we show that gBGC is probably at work in most if not all bacterial species. First we find a consistent positive relationship between the GC-content of a gene and evidence of intra-genic recombination throughout a broad spectrum of bacterial clades. Second, we show that the evolutionary force responsible for this pattern is acting independently from selection on codon usage, and could potentially interfere with selection in favor of optimal AU-ending codons. A comparison with data from human populations shows that the intensity of gBGC in Bacteria is comparable to what has been reported in mammals. We propose that gBGC is not restricted to sexual Eukaryotes but also widespread among Bacteria and could therefore be an ancestral feature of cellular organisms. We argue that if gBGC occurs in bacteria, it can account for previously unexplained observations, such as the apparent non-equilibrium of base substitution patterns and the heterogeneity of gene composition within bacterial genomes. Because gBGC produces patterns similar to positive selection, it is essential to take this process into account when studying the evolutionary forces at work in bacterial genomes.},

First, we show that isoaccepting tRNA gene copy numbers correlate positively with expression-weighted frequencies of amino acids and codons. Using expression data of more than 14,000 human genes, we show a weak positive correlation between gene expression level and frequency of optimal codons (codons with highest tRNA gene copy number). Interestingly, contrary to non-mammalian eukaryotes, codon bias tends to be high in both highly expressed genes and lowly expressed genes. We suggest that selection may act on codon bias, not only to increase elongation rate by favoring optimal codons in highly expressed genes, but also to reduce elongation rate by favoring non-optimal codons in lowly expressed genes. We also show that the frequency of optimal codons is in positive correlation with estimates of protein biosynthetic cost, and suggest another possible action of selection on codon bias: preference of optimal codons as production cost rises, to reduce the rate of amino acid misincorporation. In the analyses of this work, we introduce a new measure of frequency of optimal codons (FOP'), which is unaffected by amino acid composition and is corrected for background nucleotide content; we also introduce a new method for computing expected codon frequencies, based on the dinucleotide composition of the introns and the non-coding regions surrounding a gene.},

Here we test whether the compositional variation is due to mutation bias using two new tests, which do not assume compositional equilibrium. In the first test we assume a standard population genetics model, but in the second we make no assumptions about the underlying population genetics. We apply the tests to single-nucleotide polymorphism data from noncoding regions of the human genome. Both models of neutral mutation bias fit the frequency distributions of SNPs segregating in low- and medium-GC-content regions of the genome adequately, although both suggest compositional nonequilibrium. However, neither model fits the frequency distribution of SNPs from the high-GC-content regions. In contrast, a simple population genetics model that incorporates selection or biased gene conversion cannot be rejected. The results suggest that mutation biases are not solely responsible for the compositional biases found in noncoding regions.},

  abstract = {GC-favouring gene conversion enables fixation of deleterious alleles, disturbs tests of natural selection and potentially explains both the evolution of recombination as well as the commonly reported intragenomic correlation between G+C content and recombination rate. In addition, gene conversion disturbs linkage disequilibrium, potentially affecting the ability to detect causative variants. However, the importance and generality of these effects is unresolved, not simply because direct analyses are technically challenging but also because previous within- and between-species discrepant results can be hard to appraise owing to methodological differences. Here we report results of methodologically uniform whole-genome sequencing of all tetrad products in Saccharomyces, Neurospora, Chlamydomonas and Arabidopsis. The proportion of polymorphic markers converted varies over three orders of magnitude between species (from 2\% of markers converted in yeast to only \textasciitilde{}0.005\% in the two plants) with at least 87.5\% of the variance in per tetrad conversion rates being between species. This is largely due to differences in recombination rate and median tract length. Despite three of the species showing a positive GC-recombination correlation, there is no significant net AT\textrightarrow{}GC conversion bias in any of the species, despite relatively high resolution in the two taxa (Saccharomyces and Neurospora) with relatively common gene conversion. The absence of a GC bias means that: (1) there should be no presumption that gene conversion is GC biased, or (2) that a GC-recombination correlation necessarily implies biased gene conversion, (3) K

By integrating the central observations from molecular biology and population genetics relevant to comparative genomics, Lynch shows why the details matter. Presented in a nontechnical fashion, at both the population-genetic and molecular-genetic levels, this book offers a unifying explanatory framework for how the peculiar architectural diversity of eukaryotic genomes and genes came to arise. Under Lynch's hypothesis, the genome-wide repatterning of eukaryotic gene structure, which resulted primarily from nonadaptive processes, provided an entirely novel resource from which natural selection could secondarily build new forms of organismal complexity.},

Here, recently established databases on de novo mutations for monogenic disorders are used to estimate the rate and molecular spectrum of spontaneously arising mutations and to derive a number of inferences with respect to eukaryotic genome evolution. Although the human per-generation mutation rate is exceptionally high, on a per-cell division basis, the human germline mutation rate is lower than that recorded for any other species. Comparison with data from other species demonstrates a universal mutational bias toward A/T composition, and leads to the hypothesis that genome-wide nucleotide composition generally evolves to the point at which the power of selection in favor of G/C is approximately balanced by the power of random genetic drift, such that variation in equilibrium genome-wide nucleotide composition is largely defined by variation in mutation biases. Quantification of the hazards associated with introns reveals that mutations at key splice-site residues are a major source of human mortality. Finally, a consideration of the long-term consequences of current human behavior for deleterious-mutation accumulation leads to the conclusion that a substantial reduction in human fitness can be expected over the next few centuries in industrialized societies unless novel means of genetic intervention are developed.},

Fourfold redundant silent sites and a restricted region of intronic sites appear to evolve in a nearly neutral fashion, providing a powerful tool for population genetic analyses.

Biochem. 76, 13\textendash{}19] were centrifuged in Cs2SO4/Ag+ density gradients. These experiments led to the preparation of the DNA components which had been detected (by analytical centrifugation in CsCl) in the Cs2SO4/BAMD fractions, and also of DNA components which had identical behaviors in Cs2SO4/BAMD gradients and identical buoyant densities in CsCl. A total of eight satellite components and 11 minor components, accounting for 23\% and 4\% of the bovine genome, respectively, were thus isolated and characterized in their relative amounts and buoyant densities. The implications of these results on the interpretation of renaturation kinetic data on the bovine genome are discussed.},

  abstract = {Understanding the factors responsible for variations in mutation
 patterns and selection efficacy along chromosomes is a prerequisite for
 deciphering genome sequences. Population genetics models predict a
 positive correlation between the efficacy of selection at a given locus
 and the local rate of recombination because of Hill\textendash{}Robertson effects.
 Codon usage is considered one of the most striking examples that
 support this prediction at the molecular level. In a wide range of
 species including Caenorhabditis elegans
 and Drosophila melanogaster, codon usage is essentially
 shaped by selection acting for translational efficiency. Codon usage
 bias correlates positively with recombination rate in
 Drosophila, apparently supporting the hypothesis that
 selection on codon usage is improved by recombination. Here we present
 an exhaustive analysis of codon usage in C. elegans and
 D. melanogaster complete genomes. We show that in both
 genomes there is a positive correlation between recombination rate and
 the frequency of optimal codons. However, we demonstrate that in both
 species, this effect is due to a mutational bias toward G and C bases
 in regions of high recombination rate, possibly as a direct consequence
 of the recombination process. The correlation between codon usage bias
 and recombination rate in these species appears to be essentially
 determined by recombination-dependent mutational patterns, rather than
 selective effects. This result highlights that it is necessary to take
 into account the mutagenic effect of recombination to understand the
 evolutionary role and impact of recombination.},

  abstract = {In many unicellular organisms, invertebrates, and plants, synonymous codon usage biases result from a coadaptation between codon usage and tRNAs abundance to optimize the efficiency of protein synthesis. However, it remains unclear whether natural selection acts at the level of the speed or the accuracy of mRNAs translation. Here we show that codon usage can improve the fidelity of protein synthesis in multicellular species. As predicted by the model of selection for translational accuracy, we find that the frequency of codons optimal for translation is significantly higher at codons encoding for conserved amino acids than at codons encoding for nonconserved amino acids in 548 genes compared between Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens. Although this model predicts that codon bias correlates positively with gene length, a negative correlation between codon bias and gene length has been observed in eukaryotes. This suggests that selection for fidelity of protein synthesis is not the main factor responsible for codon biases. The relationship between codon bias and gene length remains unexplained. Exploring the differences in gene expression process in eukaryotes and prokaryotes should provide new insights to understand this key question of codon usage.},

  abstract = {According to population genetics models, genomic regions with lower crossing-over rates are expected to experience less effective selection because of Hill-Robertson interference (HRi). The effect of genetic linkage is thought to be particularly important for a selection of weak intensity such as selection affecting codon usage. Consistent with this model, codon bias correlates positively with recombination rate in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. However, in these species, the G+C content of both noncoding DNA and synonymous sites correlates positively with recombination, which suggests that mutation patterns and recombination are associated. To remove this effect of mutation patterns on codon bias, we used the synonymous sites of lowly expressed genes that are expected to be effectively neutral sites. We measured the differences between codon biases of highly expressed genes and their lowly expressed neighbors. In D. melanogaster we find that HRi weakly reduces selection on codon usage of genes located in regions of very low recombination; but these genes only comprise 4\% of the total. In C. elegans we do not find any evidence for the effect of recombination on selection for codon bias. Computer simulations indicate that HRi poorly enhances codon bias if the local recombination rate is greater than the mutation rate. This prediction of the model is consistent with our data and with the current estimate of the mutation rate in D. melanogaster. The case of C. elegans, which is highly self-fertilizing, is discussed. Our results suggest that HRi is a minor determinant of variations in codon bias across the genome.},

Codon usage bias of 1,117 Drosophila melanogaster genes, as well as fewer D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis genes, was examined from the perspective of relative abundance of isoaccepting tRNAs and their changes during development. We found that each amino acid contributes about equally and highly significantly to overall codon usage bias, with the exception of Asp which had very low contribution to overall bias. Asp was also the only amino acid that did not show a clear preference for one of its synonymous codons. Synonymous codon usage in Drosophila was consistent with ``optimal'' codons deduced from the isoaccepting tRNA availability. Interestingly, amino acids whose major isoaccepting tRNAs change during development did not show as strong bias as those with developmentally unchanged tRNA pools. Asp is the only amino acid for which the major isoaccepting tRNAs change between larval and adult stages. We conclude that synonymous codon usage in Drosophila is well explained by tRNA availability and is probably influenced by developmental changes in relative abundance.},

In murids, both distributions begin at higher and end at lower GC values. A comparison of homologous coding sequences from murids and humans revealed that their different compositional distributions are due to differences in GC levels in all three codon positions, particularly of genes located at both ends of the distribution. In turn, these differences are responsible for differences in both codon usage and amino acids. When GC levels at first + second codon positions and third codon positions, respectively, of murid genes are plotted against corresponding GC levels of homologous human genes, linear relationships (with very high correlation coefficients and slopes of about 0.78 and 0.60, respectively) are found. This indicates a conservation of the order of GC levels in homologous genes from humans and murids. (The same comparison for mouse and rat genes indicates a conservation of GC levels of homologous genes.) A similar linear relationship was observed when plotting GC levels of corresponding DNA fractions (as obtained by density gradient centrifugation in the presence of a sequence-specific ligand) from mouse and human. These findings indicate that orderly compositional changes affecting not only coding sequences but also noncoding sequences took place since the divergence of murids. Such directional fixations of mutations point to the existence of selective pressures affecting the genome as a whole.},

There is, therefore, a compositional gradient of gene concentration in the human genome.

  abstract = {The genomes of many vertebrates show a characteristic heterogeneous distribution of GC content, the so-called GC isochore structure. The origin of isochores has been explained via the mechanism of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). However, although the isochore structure is declining in many mammalian genomes, the heterogeneity in GC content is being reinforced in the avian genome. Despite this discrepancy, which remains unexplained, examinations of individual substitution frequencies in mammals and birds are both consistent with the gBGC model of isochore evolution. On the other hand, a negative correlation between substitution and recombination rate found in the chicken genome is inconsistent with the gBGC model. It should therefore be important to consider along with gBGC other consequences of recombination on the origin and fate of mutations, as well as to account for relationships between recombination rate and other genomic features. We therefore developed an analytical model to describe the substitution patterns found in the chicken genome, and further investigated the relationships between substitution patterns and several genomic features in a rigorous statistical framework. Our analysis indicates that GC content itself, either directly or indirectly via interrelations to other genomic features, has an impact on the substitution pattern. Further, we suggest that this phenomenon is particularly visible in avian genomes due to their unusually low rate of chromosomal evolution. Because of this, interrelations between GC content and other genomic features are being reinforced, and are as such more pronounced in avian genomes as compared with other vertebrate genomes with a less stable karyotype.},

Understanding how the recombination landscape has evolved in humans is thus key to the interpretation of human genomic evolution. Comparison of fine-scale recombination maps of human and chimpanzee has revealed large changes at fine genomic scales and conservation over large scales. Here we demonstrate how a fine-scale recombination map can be derived for the ancestor of human and chimpanzee, allowing us to study the changes that have occurred in human and chimpanzee since these species diverged. The map is produced from more than one million accurately determined recombination events. We find that this new recombination map is intermediate to the maps of human and chimpanzee but that the recombination landscape has evolved more rapidly in the human lineage than in the chimpanzee lineage. We use the map to show that recombination rate, through the effect of GC-biased gene conversion, is an even stronger determinant of base composition evolution than previously reported.},

Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; the diploid, monoecious population mates at random. Under the assumption that all four evolutionary forces are weak, a diffusion approximation is established for the dynamics of the gene frequencies. For two alleles, the inclusion of gene conversion merely alters one of the two selection parameters of the thoroughly investigated diffusion process without conversion. Therefore, all results for this classical process, some of which are reviewed and extended here, are immediately applicable to the biologically more general problem. Small conversional disparities can dramatically affect the fixation probability (and hence the rate of gene substitution) and can greatly reduce the mean conditional fixation time of a new mutant. The mean absorption and fixation times are often sufficiently short to imply that biased gene conversion can be an important mechanism for the loss of genetic variability in and the genetic divergence of isolated populations.},

Several nonexclusive hypotheses have been proposed to account for this apparent paradox (high new mutation rate, genetic drift, overdominance, or recent changes in selective pressure). However, the factors ultimately responsible for the presence at high frequency of disease-causing mutations are still contentious. Here we establish the existence of an additional process that contributes to the spreading of deleterious mutations: GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), a process associated with recombination that tends to favor the transmission of GC-alleles over AT-alleles. We show that the spectrum of amino acid-altering polymorphisms in human populations exhibits the footprints of gBGC. This pattern cannot be explained in terms of selection and is evident with all nonsynonymous mutations, including those predicted to be detrimental to protein structure and function, and those implicated in human genetic disease. We present simulations to illustrate the conditions under which gBGC can extend the persistence time of deleterious mutations in a finite population. These results indicate that gBGC meiotic drive contributes to the spreading of deleterious mutations in human populations.Hum Mutat 32: 1-9, 2011. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We describe here the relationship between body weight and abundance in British birds, whose population size estimates are unusually good. Abundance across all species declines with a -0.75 power of body weight, which conforms with the energetic equivalence 'rule'2,16. There is, however, a significant positive relationship between abundance and body weight within lower taxa. Those tribes that do not share recent common ancestry with other British birds are most likely to show a positive relationship across their constituent species. We thus show that phylogenetic relatedness might be an important indicator of the structure of the relationship between body size and abundance.},

In some crosses, nine additional phenotypically silent RFLP mutations were present at approximately 100-bp intervals. Increasing heterology from 0.2 to 1\% in this interval reduced spontaneous, but not DSB-induced, recombination. For DSB-induced events, 75\% were continuous tract gene conversions without a crossover in this interval; discontinuous tracts and conversions associated with a crossover each comprised approximately 7\% of events, and 10\% also converted markers in unbroken alleles. Loss of heterozygosity was seen for all markers centromere distal to the HO site in 50\% of products; such loss could reflect gene conversion, break-induced replication, chromosome loss, or G2 crossovers. Using telomere-marked strains we determined that nearly all allelic DSB repair occurs by gene conversion. We further show that most allelic conversion results from mismatch repair of heteroduplex DNA. Interestingly, markers shared between the sparsely and densely marked interval converted at higher rates in the densely marked interval. Thus, the extra markers increased gene conversion tract lengths, which may reflect mismatch repair-induced recombination, or a shift from restoration- to conversion-type repair.},

However, the reason for this variation is still an open question. Different kinds of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the variation of GC content during genome evolution. However, these hypotheses have not been explicitly investigated in whole plastome sequences. Dendrobium is one of the largest genera in the orchid species. Evolutionary studies of the plastomic organization and base composition are limited in this genus. In this study, we obtained the high-quality plastome sequences of D. loddigesii and D. devonianum. The comparison results showed a nearly identical organization in Dendrobium plastomes, indicating that the plastomic organization is highly conserved in Dendrobium genus. Furthermore, the impact of three evolutionary forces\textemdash{}selection, mutational biases, and GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC)\textemdash{}on the variation of GC content in Dendrobium plastomes was evaluated. Our results revealed: (1) consistent GC content evolution trends and mutational biases in single-copy (SC) and inverted repeats (IRs) regions; and (2) that gBGC has influenced the plastome-wide GC content evolution. These results suggest that both mutational biases and gBGC affect GC content in the plastomes of Dendrobium genus.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination ensures the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation and contributes to DNA diversity through both large-scale reciprocal crossovers and very localised gene conversion events, also known as noncrossovers. Considerable progress has been made in understanding factors such as PRDM9 and SNP variants that influence the initiation of recombination at human hotspots but very little is known about factors acting downstream. To address this, we simultaneously analysed both types of recombinant molecule in sperm DNA at six highly active hotspots, and looked for disparity in the transmission of allelic variants indicative of any cis-acting influences. At two of the hotspots we identified a novel form of biased transmission that was exclusive to the noncrossover class of recombinant, and which presumably arises through differences between crossovers and noncrossovers in heteroduplex formation and biased mismatch repair. This form of biased gene conversion is not predicted to influence hotspot activity as previously noted for SNPs that affect recombination initiation, but does constitute a powerful and previously undetected source of recombination-driven meiotic drive that by extrapolation may affect thousands of recombination hotspots throughout the human genome. Intriguingly, at both of the hotspots described here, this drive favours strong (G/C) over weak (A/T) base pairs as might be predicted from the well-established correlations between high GC content and recombination activity in mammalian genomes.},

  abstract = {Genes evolve at different rates depending on the strength of selective pressure to maintain their function. Chromosomal position can also have an influence [1] [2]. The pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of mammalian sex chromosomes is a small region of sequence identity that is the site of an obligatory pairing and recombination event between the X and Y chromosomes during male meiosis [3] [4] [5] [6]. During female meiosis, X chromosomes can pair and recombine along their entire length. Recombination in the PAR is therefore approximately 10 times greater in male meiosis compared with female meiosis [4] [5] [6]. The gene Fxy (also known as MID1 [7]) spans the pseudoautosomal boundary (PAB) in the laboratory mouse (Mus musculus domesticus, C57BL/6) such that the 5' three exons of the gene are located on the X chromosome but the seven exons encoding the carboxy-terminal two-thirds of the protein are located within the PAR and are therefore present on both the X and Y chromosomes [8]. In humans [7] [9], the rat, and the wild mouse species Mus spretus, the gene is entirely X-unique. Here, we report that the rate of sequence divergence of the 3' end of the Fxy gene is much higher (estimated at 170-fold higher for synonymous sites) when pseudoautosomal (present on both the X and Y chromosomes) than when X-unique. Thus, chromosomal position can directly affect the rate of evolution of a gene. This finding also provides support for the suggestion that regions of the genome with a high recombination frequency, such as the PAR, may have an intrinsically elevated rate of sequence divergence.},

To study all species of our dataset, we used chromosome size as a proxy for recombination rate and compared it with GC content. Among the 17 species showing a significant relationship between GC content and chromosome size, 15 are consistent with the predictions of the gBGC model. Importantly, the species showing a pattern consistent with gBGC are found in all the four major groups of eukaryotes studied, which suggests that gBGC may be widespread in eukaryotes.},

However, most comparisons have been made among distantly related organisms that differ not only in Ne but also in many other aspects of their biology.

Mice were genotyped using a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array, and the proportions of replacement and silent mutations within subspecies were compared with those fixed between each subspecies and an outgroup, Mus spretus. There was significant evidence of positive selection in M. m. castaneus, the lineage with the largest Ne, with {$\alpha$} estimated to be approximately 40\%. In contrast, estimates of {$\alpha$} for M. m. domesticus ({$\alpha$} = 13\%) and for M. m. musculus ({$\alpha$} = 12 \%) were much smaller. Interestingly, the higher estimate of {$\alpha$} for M. m. castaneus appears to reflect not only more adaptive fixations but also more effective purifying selection. These results support the hypothesis that differences in Ne contribute to differences among species in the efficacy of selection.},

The accelerated elements, and in particular the top five, show a strong bias for adenine and thymine to guanine and cytosine nucleotide changes and are disproportionately located in high recombination and high guanine and cytosine content environments near telomeres, suggesting either biased gene conversion or isochore selection. In addition, there is some evidence of directional selection in the regions containing the two most accelerated regions. A combination of evolutionary forces has contributed to accelerated evolution of the fastest evolving elements in the human genome.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is an important evolutionary force shaping the nucleotide landscape of genomes. For most vertebrates, the frequency of recombination varies slightly or considerably between the sexes (heterochiasmy). In humans, male, rather than female, recombination rate has been found to be more highly correlated with the guanine and cytosine (GC) content across the genome. In the present study, we review the results in human and extend the examination of the evolutionary impact of heterochiasmy beyond primates to include four additional eutherian mammals (mouse, dog, pig, and sheep), a metatherian mammal (opossum), and a bird (chicken). Specifically, we compared sex-specific recombination rates (RRs) with nucleotide substitution patterns evaluated in transposable elements. Our results, based on a comparative approach, reveal a great diversity in the relationship between heterochiasmy and nucleotide composition. We find that the stronger male impact on this relationship is a conserved feature of human, mouse, dog, and sheep. In contrast, variation in genomic GC content in pig and opossum is more strongly correlated with female, rather than male, RR. Moreover, we show that the sex-differential impact of recombination is mainly driven by the chromosomal localization of recombination events. Independent of sex, the higher the RR in a genomic region and the longer this recombination activity is conserved in time, the stronger the bias in nucleotide substitution pattern, through such mechanisms as biased gene conversion. Over time, this bias will increase the local GC content of the region.},

  abstract = {Synonymous codon usage (SCU) varies widely among human genes. In particular, genes involved in different functional categories display a distinct codon usage, which was interpreted as evidence that SCU is adaptively constrained to optimize translation efficiency in distinct cellular states. We demonstrate here that SCU is not driven by constraints on tRNA abundance, but by large-scale variation in GC-content, caused by meiotic recombination, via the non-adaptive process of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). Expression in meiotic cells is associated with a strong decrease in recombination within genes. Differences in SCU among functional categories reflect differences in levels of meiotic transcription, which is linked to variation in recombination and therefore in gBGC. Overall, the gBGC model explains 70\% of the variance in SCU among genes. We argue that the strong heterogeneity of SCU induced by gBGC in mammalian genomes precludes any optimization of the tRNA pool to the demand in codon usage.},

Here, we use high-quality human genomic data to show that purifying selection at linked sites (i.e. background selection, BGS) and GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) together affect as much as 95\% of the variants of our genome. We find that the magnitude and relative importance of BGS and gBGC are largely determined by variation in recombination rate and base composition. Importantly, synonymous sites and non-transcribed regions are also affected, albeit to different degrees. Their use for demographic inference can lead to strong biases. However, by conditioning on genomic regions with recombination rates above 1.5 cM/Mb and mutation types (C{$\leftrightarrow$}G, A{$\leftrightarrow$}T), we identify a set of SNPs that is mostly unaffected by BGS or gBGC, and that avoids these biases in the reconstruction of human history.},

To assess the uniqueness of human noncoding evolution, we examined CNSs accelerated in chimpanzee and mouse. Although we observed a similar enrichment near neuronal adhesion genes in chimpanzee, the accelerated CNSs themselves exhibited almost no overlap with those in human, suggesting independent evolution toward different neuronal phenotypes in each species. CNSs accelerated in mouse showed no bias toward neuronal cell adhesion. Our results indicate that widespread cis-regulatory changes in human evolution may have contributed to uniquely human features of brain development and function.},

  abstract = {The identification of loci influenced by positive selection is a major goal of evolutionary genetics. A popular approach is to perform scans of alignments on a genome-wide scale in order to find regions evolving at accelerated rates on a particular branch of a phylogenetic tree. However, positive selection is not the only process that can lead to accelerated evolution. Notably, GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) is a recombination-associated process that results in the biased fixation of G and C nucleotides. This process can potentially generate bursts of nucleotide substitutions within hotspots of meiotic recombination. Here, we analyse the results of a scan for positive selection on genes on branches across the primate phylogeny. We show that genes identified as targets of positive selection have a significant tendency to exhibit the genomic signature of gBGC. Using a maximum-likelihood framework, we estimate that more than 20 per cent of cases of significantly elevated non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates ratio (dN/dS), particularly in shorter branches, could be due to gBGC. We demonstrate that in some cases, gBGC can lead to very high dN/dS (more than 2). Our results indicate that gBGC significantly affects the evolution of coding sequences in primates, often leading to patterns of evolution that can be mistaken for positive selection.},

  abstract = {There is a long-standing debate in molecular evolution concerning the putative importance of GC content in adapting the thermal stabilities of DNA and RNA. Most studies of this relationship have examined broad-scale compositional patterns, for example, total GC percentages in genomes and occurrence of GC-rich isochores. Few studies have systematically examined the GC contents of individual orthologous genes from differently thermally adapted species. When this has been done, the emphasis has been on comparing large numbers of genes in only a few species. We have approached the GC-adaptation temperature hypothesis in a different manner by examining patterns of base composition of genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase-A (ldh-a) and alpha-actin (alpha-actin) from 51 species of vertebrates whose adaptation temperatures ranged from -1.86 degrees C (Antarctic fishes) to approximately 45 degrees C (desert reptile). No significant positive correlation was found between any index of GC content (GC content of the entire sequence, GC content of the third codon position [GC(3)], and GC content at fourfold degenerate sites [GC(4)]) and any index of adaptation temperature (maximal, mean, or minimal body temperature). For alpha-actin, slopes of regression lines for all comparisons did not differ significantly from zero. For ldh-a, negative correlations between adaptation temperature and total GC content, GC(3), and GC(4) were observed but were shown to be due entirely to phylogenetic influences (as revealed by independent contrast analyses). This comparison of GC content across a wide range of ectothermic ("cold-blooded") and endothermic ("warm-blooded") vertebrates revealed that frogs of the genus Xenopus, which have commonly been used as a representative cold-blooded species, in fact are outliers among ectotherms for the alpha-actin analyses, raising concern about the appropriateness of choosing these amphibians as representative of ectothermic vertebrates in general. Our study indicates that, whereas GC contents of isochores may show variation among different classes of vertebrates, there is no consistent relationship between adaptation temperature and the percentage of thermal stability-enhancing G + C base pairs in protein-coding genes.},

Chromatin structural assays can efficiently integrate information across diverse regulatory elements, revealing the functional noncoding genome. In this study, we use a differential nuclease sensitivity assay based on micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion to discover open chromatin regions in the maize genome. We find that maize MNase-hypersensitive (MNase HS) regions localize around active genes and within recombination hotspots, focusing biased gene conversion at their flanks. Although MNase HS regions map to less than 1\% of the genome, they consistently explain a remarkably large amount ({$\sim$}40\%) of heritable phenotypic variance in diverse complex traits. MNase HS regions are therefore on par with coding sequences as annotations that demarcate the functional parts of the maize genome. These results imply that less than 3\% of the maize genome (coding and MNase HS regions) may give rise to the overwhelming majority of phenotypic variation, greatly narrowing the scope of the functional genome.},

  abstract = {Whether codon usage fine-tunes mRNA translation in mammals remains controversial, with recent papers suggesting that production of proteins in specific Gene Ontological (GO) pathways can be regulated by actively modifying the codon and anticodon pools in different cellular conditions. In this work, we compared the sequence content of genes in specific GO categories with the exonic genome background. Although a substantial fraction of variability in codon usage could be explained by random sampling, almost half of GO sets showed more variability in codon usage than expected by chance. Nevertheless, by quantifying translational efficiency in healthy and cancerous tissues in human and mouse, we demonstrated that a given tRNA pool can equally well translate many different sets of mRNAs, irrespective of their cell-type specificity. This disconnect between variations in codon usage and the stability of translational efficiency is best explained by differences in GC content between gene sets. GC variation across the mammalian genome is most likely a result of the interplay between genome repair and gene duplication mechanisms, rather than selective pressures caused by codon-driven translational rates. Consequently, codon usage differences in mammalian transcriptomes are most easily explained by well-understood mutational biases acting on the underlying genome.},

Genet., 12, 2411, 2003) recently reported a strong correlation between gene expression breadth and GC-content, suggesting that there might be a selective pressure favoring the concentration of housekeeping genes in GC-rich isochores. We reassessed this issue by examining in human and mouse the correlation between gene expression and GC-content, using different measures of gene expression (EST, SAGE and microarray) and different measures of GC-content. We show that correlations between GC-content and expression are very weak, and may vary according to the method used to measure expression. Such weak correlations have a very low predictive value. The strong correlations reported by Lercher et al. (2003) are because of the fact that they measured variables over neighboring genes windows. We show here that using gene windows artificially enhances the correlation. The assertion that the expression of a given gene depends on the GC-content of the region where it is located is therefore not supported by the data.},

To test this model, we analyzed by internal correspondence analysis the codon usage of 2,126 human tissue-specific genes expressed in 18 different tissues. We confirm that synonymous codon usage differs significantly between the tissues. However, the effect is very weak: the variability of synonymous codon usage between tissues represents only 2.3\% of the total codon usage variability. Moreover, this variability is directly linked to isochore-scale ({$>$}100 kb) variability of GC-content that affect both coding and introns or intergenic regions. This demonstrates that variations of synonymous codon usage between tissue-specific genes expressed in different tissues are due to regional variations of substitution patterns and not to translational selection.},

It reveals the possible role of GC-biased gene conversion, a recombination-associated process favoring G and C bases., Nucleotide landscapes, which are the way base composition is distributed along a genome, strongly vary among species. The underlying causes of these variations have been much debated. Though mutational bias and selection were initially invoked, GC-biased gene conversion (), a recombination-associated process favoring the G and C over A and T bases, is increasingly recognized as a major factor. As opposed to vertebrates, evolution of GC content is less well known in plants. Most studies have focused on the GC-poor and homogeneous Arabidopsis thaliana genome and the much more GC-rich and heterogeneous rice (Oryza sativa) genome and have often been generalized as a dicot/monocot dichotomy. This vision is clearly phylogenetically biased and does not allow understanding the mechanisms involved in GC content evolution in plants. To tackle these issues, we used EST data from more than 200 species and provided the most comprehensive description of gene GC content across the seed plant phylogeny so far available. As opposed to the classically assumed dicot/monocot dichotomy, we found continuous variations in GC content from the probably ancestral GC-poor and homogeneous genomes to the more derived GC-rich and highly heterogeneous ones, with several independent enrichment episodes. Our results suggest that  could play a significant role in the evolution of GC content in plant genomes.},

First, despite being silent, they may be subject to natural selection. Among eukaryotes this is exemplified by yeast, where synonymous codon usage patterns are shaped by selection for particular codons that are more efficiently and/or accurately translated by the most abundant tRNAs; codon usage across the genome, and the abundance of different tRNA species, are highly co-adapted. Second, in the absence of selection, silent sites reveal underlying mutational patterns. Codon usage varies enormously among human genes, and yet silent sites do not appear to be influenced by natural selection, suggesting that mutation patterns vary among regions of the genome. At first, the yeast and human genomes were thought to reflect a dichotomy between unicellular and multicellular organisms. However, it now appears that natural selection shapes codon usage in some multicellular species (e.g. Drosophila and Caenorhabditis), and that regional variations in mutation biases occur in yeast. Silent sites (in serine codons) also provide evidence for mutational events changing adjacent nucleotides simultaneously.},

This variation is associated with differences in G+C content at silent sites, but (unlike the situation in mammalian genes) these differences are not correlated with variation in intron base composition and so are not easily explicable in terms of mutational biases. Instead, those genes with high G+C content at silent sites, resulting from a strong "preference" for a particular subset of the codons that are mostly C-ending, appear to be the more highly expressed genes. This suggests that G+C content is reduced in sequences where selective constraints are weaker, as indeed seen in a pseudogene. These and other data discussed are consistent with the effects of translational selection among synonymous codons, as seen in unicellular organisms. The existence of selective constraints on silent substitutions, which may vary in strength among genes, has implications for the use of silent molecular clocks.},

Here, we address this limitation by sequencing 41 rice individuals with high sequencing coverage and c. 900 000 accurate markers. An average of 33.9 crossover (c. 4.53 cM Mb-1) and 2.47 non-crossover events were detected per F2 plant, which is similar to the values in Arabidopsis. Although not all samples in the stress treatment group showed an increased number of crossover events, environmental stress increased the recombination rate in c. 28.5\% of samples. Interestingly, the crossovers showed a highly uneven distribution among and along chromosomes, with c. 13.9\% of the entire genome devoid of crossovers, including 11 of the 12 centromere regions, and c. 0.72\% of the genome containing large numbers of crossovers ({$>$} 50 cM Mb-1).

  abstract = {Recombination is an engine of genetic diversity and therefore constitutes a key process in evolutionary biology and genetics. While the outcome of crossover recombination can readily be detected as shuffled alleles by following the inheritance of markers in pedigreed families, the more precise location of both crossover and non-crossover recombination events has been difficult to pinpoint. As a consequence, we lack a detailed portrait of the recombination landscape for most organisms and knowledge on how this landscape impacts on sequence evolution at a local scale. To localize recombination events with high resolution in an avian system, we performed whole-genome re-sequencing at high coverage of a complete three-generation collared flycatcher pedigree. We identified 325 crossovers at a median resolution of 1.4 kb, with 86\% of the events localized to {$<$}10 kb intervals. Observed crossover rates were in excellent agreement with data from linkage mapping, were 52\% higher in male (3.56 cM/Mb) than in female meiosis (2.28 cM/Mb), and increased towards chromosome ends in male but not female meiosis. Crossover events were non-randomly distributed in the genome with several distinct hot-spots and a concentration to genic regions, with the highest density in promoters and CpG islands. We further identified 267 non-crossovers, whose location was significantly associated with crossover locations. We detected a significant transmission bias (0.18) in favour of 'strong' (G, C) over 'weak' (A, T) alleles at non-crossover events, providing direct evidence for the process of GC-biased gene conversion in an avian system. The approach taken in this study should be applicable to any species and would thereby help to provide a more comprehensive portray of the recombination landscape across organism groups.},

Mice heterozygous at two pseudoautosomal alleles, the steroid sulfatase gene and the Mov-15 provirus marker, were crossed. The provirus in the Mov-15 transgenic mouse strain had been previously shown to be carried in the pseudoautosomal region of the sex chromosomes. Recombination frequencies were shown to be 7-fold higher in this region in male meiosis than in female meiosis. Three-point crosses indicated the occurrence in male meiosis of double recombination events in the pseudoautosomal region, with little or no crossover interference, which is in marked contrast to observations made on the similar region of the human sex chromosomes. This result is contrary to a previous model, which predicted a single crossover event in male meiotic pairing of mammalian sex chromosomes.},

  abstract = {Homologous recombination (HR) and mismatch repair (MMR) are inextricably linked. HR pairs homologous chromosomes before meiosis I and is ultimately responsible for generating genetic diversity during sexual reproduction. HR is initiated in meiosis by numerous programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs; several hundred in mammals). A characteristic feature of HR is the exchange of DNA strands, which results in the formation of heteroduplex DNA. Mismatched nucleotides arise in heteroduplex DNA because the participating parental chromosomes contain nonidentical sequences. These mismatched nucleotides may be processed by MMR, resulting in nonreciprocal exchange of genetic information (gene conversion). MMR and HR also play prominent roles in mitotic cells during genome duplication; MMR rectifies polymerase misincorporation errors, whereas HR contributes to replication fork maintenance, as well as the repair of spontaneous DSBs and genotoxic lesions that affect both DNA strands. MMR suppresses HR when the heteroduplex DNA contains excessive mismatched nucleotides, termed homeologous recombination. The regulation of homeologous recombination by MMR ensures the accuracy of DSB repair and significantly contributes to species barriers during sexual reproduction. This review discusses the history, genetics, biochemistry, biophysics, and the current state of studies on the role of MMR in homologous and homeologous recombination from bacteria to humans.},

  abstract = {DNA preparations from 25 eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to man, were analyzed in their base composition, sedimentation coefficient, modal and mean buoyant density in CsCl. Four mammalian and two amphibian DNAs were fractionated by preparative Cs2SO4-Ag+ density gradient centrifugation. The CsCl band profile of each fraction was analyzed in terms of Gaussian curves; this allowed the buoyant densities and the relative amounts of the components present in each DNA to be assessed. Direct analysis of the CsCl band profiles of unfractionated DNA showed a satisfactory agreement with the results obtained in the combined Cs2SO4-Ag+, CsCl investigations. This simpler procedure was therefore applied to all 25 eukaryotic DNAs. The main finding of this work is the recognition of phylogenetic differences at the macromolecular level in the organization of eukaryotic genomes. The differences concerning the main band DNA are: (a) the three major components (1{$\cdot$}697, 1{$\cdot$}704 and 1{$\cdot$}709 g/cm3) first observed in the main band of calf DNA by Filipski et al. (1973) were also found in the other ten mammalian DNAs investigated here; similar components appear to be present in avian genomes; in both cases, the 1{$\cdot$}704 and 1{$\cdot$}709 g/cm3 components are responsible for the skewness to the heavy side of the CsCl main band of these DNAs; (b) the DNAs of reptiles, amphibians and fish showed a much lower and decreasing skewness of their CsCl bands compared to both mammalian and avian DNAs; the Cs2SO4-Ag+, CsCl combined analysis of two amphibian DNAs revealed discrete components, different from those of mammals and birds; (c) essentially symmetrical bands in CsCl were exhibited by three invertebrate DNAs; (d) the DNAs from three unicellular eukaryotes exhibited perfectly symmetrical bands in CsCl and could not be resolved into discrete comoponents.

In contrast, in species with large population sizes, selection is expected to be a much more effective force. Evidence for this has come from examining how genic parameters vary with expression level, which appears to determine many of a gene's features, such as codon bias, amino acid composition, and size. However, not until now has it been possible to examine whether human genes show the signature of selection mediated by expression level. Here, then, to investigate this issue, we gathered expression data for {$>$}10,000 human genes from public data sets obtained by different technologies (SAGE and high-density oligonucleotide chip arrays) and compared them with gene parameters. We find that, even after controlling for regional effects, highly expressed genes code for smaller proteins, have less intronic DNA, and higher codon and amino acid biases. We conclude that, contrary to the usual supposition, human genes show signatures consistent with selection mediated by expression level.},

  abstract = {The housekeeping (ubiquitously expressed) genes in the mammal genome were shown here to be on average slightly GC-richer than tissue-specific genes. Both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes occupy similar ranges of GC content, but the former tend to concentrate in the upper part of the range. In the human genome, tissue-specific genes show two maxima, GC-poor and GC-rich. The strictly tissue-specific human genes tend to concentrate in the GC-poor region; their distribution is left-skewed and thus reciprocal to the distribution of housekeeping genes. The intermediately tissue-specific genes show an intermediate GC content and the right-skewed distribution. Both in the human and mouse, genes specific for some tissues (e.g., parts of the central nervous system) have a higher average GC content than housekeeping genes. Since they are not transcribed in the germ line (in contrast to housekeeping genes), and therefore have a lower probability of inheritable gene conversion, this finding contradicts the biased gene conversion (BGC) explanation for elevated GC content in the heavy isochores of mammal genome. Genes specific for germ-line tissues (ovary, testes) show a low average GC content, which is also in contradiction to the BGC explanation. Both for the total data set and for the most part of tissues taken separately, a weak positive correlation was found between gene GC content and expression level. The fraction of ubiquitously expressed genes is nearly 1.5-fold higher in the mouse than in the human. This suggests that mouse tissues are comparatively less differentiated (on the molecular level), which can be related to a less pronounced isochoric structure of the mouse genome. In each separate tissue (in both species), tissue-specific genes do not form a clear-cut frequency peak (in contrast to housekeeping genes), but constitute a continuum with a gradually increasing degree of tissue-specificity, which probably reflects the path of cell differentiation and/or an independent use of the same protein in several unrelated tissues.},

The correlation with GC content is independent of sequence length; in turn, the nucleosome formation potential of introns and intergenic spacers positively (albeit weakly) correlates with sequence length independently of GC content. These findings help explain the functional significance of the isochores (regions differing in GC content) in the human genome as a result of optimization of genomic structure for epigenetic complexity and support the notion that noncoding DNA is important for orderly chromatin condensation and chromatin-mediated suppression of tissue-specific genes.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is a fundamental cellular process, with important consequences for evolution and genome integrity. However, we know little about how recombination rates vary across the genomes of most species and the molecular and evolutionary determinants of this variation. The honeybee, Apis mellifera, has extremely high rates of meiotic recombination, although the evolutionary causes and consequences of this are unclear. Here we use patterns of linkage disequilibrium in whole genome resequencing data from 30 diploid honeybees to construct a fine-scale map of rates of crossing over in the genome. We find that, in contrast to vertebrate genomes, the recombination landscape is not strongly punctate. Crossover rates strongly correlate with levels of genetic variation, but not divergence, which indicates a pervasive impact of selection on the genome. Germ-line methylated genes have reduced crossover rate, which could indicate a role of methylation in suppressing recombination. Controlling for the effects of methylation, we do not infer a strong association between gene expression patterns and recombination. The site frequency spectrum is strongly skewed from neutral expectations in honeybees: rare variants are dominated by AT-biased mutations, whereas GC-biased mutations are found at higher frequencies, indicative of a major influence of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), which we infer to generate an allele fixation bias 5 \textendash{} 50 times the genomic average estimated in humans. We uncover further evidence that this repair bias specifically affects transitions and favours fixation of CpG sites. Recombination, via gBGC, therefore appears to have profound consequences on genome evolution in honeybees and interferes with the process of natural selection. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the forces driving molecular evolution.},

However, the evolutionary forces responsible for these biases are still not clearly defined. In order to study the processes of mutation and fixation across the entire human genome, we analyzed patterns of substitution in Alu repeats since their insertion. We also studied patterns of human polymorphism within the repeats. There is a highly significant effect of recombination rate on the pattern of substitution, whereas no such effect is seen on the pattern of polymorphism. These results suggest that regional biases in substitution are caused by biased gene conversion, a process that increases the probability of fixation of mutations that increase GC content. Furthermore, the strongest correlate of substitution patterns is found to be male recombination rates rather than female or sex-averaged recombination rates. This indicates that in addition to sexual dimorphism in recombination rates, the sexes also differ in the relative rates of crossover and gene conversion.},

Here we analyze variation in the rate and pattern of nucleotide substitution across all autosomes in the chicken genome by comparing the present-day CR1 repeat sequences with their ancestral copies and reconstructing nucleotide substitutions with a maximum likelihood model. The results shed light on the origin and evolution of large-scale heterogeneity in GC content found in the genomes of birds and mammals--the isochore structure. In contrast to mammals, where GC content is becoming homogenized, heterogeneity in GC content is being reinforced in the chicken genome. This is also supported by patterns of substitution inferred from alignments of introns in chicken, turkey, and quail. Analysis of individual substitution frequencies is consistent with the biased gene conversion (BGC) model of isochore evolution, and it is likely that patterns of evolution in the chicken genome closely resemble those in the ancestral amniote genome, when it is inferred that isochores originated. Microchromosomes and distal regions of macrochromosomes are found to have elevated substitution rates and a more GC-biased pattern of nucleotide substitution. This can largely be accounted for by a strong correlation between GC content and the rate and pattern of substitution. The results suggest that an interaction between increased mutability at CpG motifs and fixation biases due to BGC could explain increased levels of divergence in GC-rich regions.},

  abstract = {In the traditional view of molecular evolution, the rate of point mutation is uniform over the genome of an organism and variation in the rate of nucleotide substitution among DNA regions reflects differential selective constraints. Here we provide evidence for significant variation in mutation rate among regions in the mammalian genome. We show first that substitutions at silent (degenerate) sites in protein-coding genes in mammals seem to be effectively neutral (or nearly so) as they do not occur significantly less frequently than substitutions in pseudogenes. We then show that the rate of silent substitution varies among genes and is correlated with the base composition of genes and their flanking DNA. This implies that the variation in both silent substitution rate and base composition can be attributed to systematic differences in the rate and pattern of mutation over regions of the genome. We propose that the differences arise because mutation patterns vary with the timing of replication of different chromosomal regions in the germline. This hypothesis can account for both the origin of isochores in mammalian genomes and the observation that silent nucleotide substitutions in different mammalian genes do not have the same molecular clock.},

From data on tRNA gene abundance, we find a good concordance between codon preferences and the relative abundance of isoaccepting tRNAs in the complete A. thaliana genome, consistent with models of translational selection. Both EST-based and new quantitative measures of gene expression (MPSS) suggest that codon preferences derived from information on tRNA abundance are more strongly associated with gene expression than those obtained from multivariate analysis, which provides further support for the hypothesis that codon bias in Arabidopsis is under selection mediated by tRNA abundance. Consistent with previous results, analysis of protein evolution reveals a significant correlation between gene expression level and amino acid substitution rate. Analysis by MPSS estimates of gene expression suggests that this effect is primarily the result of a correlation between the number of tissues in which a gene is expressed and the rate of amino acid substitution, which indicates that the degree of tissue specialization may be an important determinant of the rate of protein evolution in Arabidopsis.},

Mutation, recombination (by GC-biased gene conversion, gBGC), and selection have been known to shape the evolution of disease-associated mutations, but how these evolutionary forces work together is still an open question. In this study, we analyzed several human large-scale datasets (1000 Genomes, ESP6500, ExAC and ClinVar), and found that base-biased mutagenesis generates more GC\textrightarrow{}AT than AT\textrightarrow{}GC mutations, while gBGC promotes the fixation of AT\textrightarrow{}GC mutations to balance the impact of base-biased mutation on genome. Due to this effect of gBGC, purifying selection removes more deleterious AT\textrightarrow{}GC mutations than GC\textrightarrow{}AT from population, but many high-frequency (fixed and nearly fixed) deleterious AT\textrightarrow{}GC mutations are remained possibly due to high genetic load. As a special subset, disease-associated mutations follow this evolutionary rule, in which disease-associated GC\textrightarrow{}AT mutations are more enriched in rare mutations compared with AT\textrightarrow{}GC, while disease-associated AT\textrightarrow{}GC are more enriched in mutations with high frequency. Thus, we presented a base-biased evolutionary framework that explains the base-biased generation and accumulation of disease-associated mutations in human populations.},

  abstract = {Recent studies indicated that recombination is strongly mutagenic. In particular, data from the mouse pseudoautosomal boundary (PAB) suggested that locally intensive recombination increased the nucleotide substitution rate by more than 100-fold and greatly increased the GC content. Here we study the rates of nucleotide substitution in eight introns of the human and great ape XG gene, which spans the boundary between the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) and the X-specific region. Contrary to what is expected under the above hypothesis, our sequence data from humans and great apes reveal that the PAR1 introns of XG have actually evolved slightly slower than X-specific introns. Only when a New World monkey was compared with hominoids were the rates slightly increased in the PAR1 introns. In terms of base composition, although the intergenic regions of the human PAR1 show a significant increase of G and C nucleotides, the base composition of the surveyed PAR1 introns is similar to that of the X-specific introns. Direct and indirect evidence indicates that the recombination rate is, indeed, much higher in PAR1 introns than in X-specific introns, and that the present PAB has persisted since the common ancestor of hominoids. Therefore, the mutagenic effect of recombination is far weaker than previously proposed, at least in hominoid PABs.},

The rate of recombination per nucleotide, which profoundly affects the evolution of chromosomal segments, is calculated by comparing genetic and physical maps. Human physical maps have been constructed using cytogenetics, overlapping DNA clones and radiation hybrids; but the ultimate and by far the most accurate physical map is the actual nucleotide sequence. The completion of the draft human genomic sequence provides us with the best opportunity yet to compare the genetic and physical maps. Here we describe our estimates of female, male and sex-average recombination rates for about 60\% of the genome. Recombination rates varied greatly along each chromosome, from 0 to at least 9 centiMorgans per megabase (cM Mb(-1)). Among several sequence and marker parameters tested, only relative marker position along the metacentric chromosomes in males correlated strongly with recombination rate. We identified several chromosomal regions up to 6 Mb in length with particularly low (deserts) or high (jungles) recombination rates. Linkage disequilibrium was much more common and extended for greater distances in the deserts than in the jungles.},

Previous DNA sequence data from both the mitochondrial and the nuclear genomes suggested a much higher level of nucleotide diversity in the African apes than in humans. Noting that the nuclear DNA data from the apes were very limited, we previously conducted a DNA polymorphism study in humans and another in chimpanzees and bonobos, using 50 DNA segments randomly chosen from the noncoding, nonrepetitive parts of the human genome. The data revealed that the nucleotide diversity ({$\pi$}) in bonobos (0.077\%) is actually lower than that in humans (0.087\%) and that {$\pi$} in chimpanzees (0.134\%) is only 50\% higher than that in humans. In the present study we sequenced the same 50 segments in 15 western lowland gorillas and estimated {$\pi$} to be 0.158\%. This is the highest value among the African apes but is only about two times higher than that in humans. Interestingly, available mtDNA sequence data also suggest a twofold higher nucleotide diversity in gorillas than in humans, but suggest a threefold higher nucleotide diversity in chimpanzees than in humans. The higher mtDNA diversity in chimpanzees might be due to the unique pattern in the evolution of chimpanzee mtDNA. From the nuclear DNA {$\pi$} values, we estimated that the long-term effective population sizes of humans, bonobos, chimpanzees, and gorillas are, respectively, 10,400, 12,300, 21,300, and 25,200.},

  abstract = {Codon usage bias is the nonrandom use of synonymous codons for the same amino acid. Most population genetic models of codon usage evolution assume that the population is at mutation\textendash{}selection\textendash{}drift equilibrium. Natural populations, however, frequently deviate from equilibrium, often because of recent demographic changes. Here, we construct a matrix model that includes the effects of a recent change in population size on estimates of selection on preferred vs. unpreferred codons. Our results suggest that patterns of synonymous polymorphisms affecting codon usage can be quite erratic after such a change; statistical methods that fail to take demographic effects into account can then give incorrect estimates of important parameters. We propose a new method that can accurately estimate both demographic and codon usage parameters. The method also provides a simple way of testing for the effects of covariates such as gene length and level of gene expression on the intensity of selection, which we apply to a large Drosophila melanogaster polymorphism data set. Our analyses of twofold degenerate codons reveal that (i) selection acts in favor of preferred codons, (ii) there is mutational bias in favor of unpreferred codons, (iii) shorter genes and genes with higher expression levels are under stronger selection, and (iv) there is little evidence for a recent change in population size in the Zimbabwe population of D. melanogaster.},

  abstract = {Analysis of within-species polymorphism data usually relies on population genetic models that assume two alleles at a locus (e.g., the infinite sites model). However, many problems of interest can be tackled more naturally by multiallele models. In this study, I construct a model that can accommodate an arbitrary number of alleles at a locus, mutational biases, and selective differences between each of the alleles. It is constructed by representing population dynamics by a Markov transition matrix and is based on the assumption that at most two variants exist at each polymorphic site. A likelihood-based method for inferring the selection and mutational parameters of the model is constructed and is shown to have high accuracy. I use this method to jointly infer preferred codons and mutational parameters in Drosophila melanogaster. Twenty-one codons are identified as preferred, 19 of which were found previously by methods that do not use polymorphism data. Interestingly, the selective difference between the fittest and the worst codons encoding the same amino acid is positively correlated with the number of synonymous codons for that amino acid, in agreement with previous analyses of interspecies data using phylogenetic models. The inferred mutation matrix is highly asymmetric, with C--{$>$}T and G--{$>$}A being the most common and constituting approximately 18\% and approximately 19\% of all mutation events, respectively. These results suggest that the new model provides a useful framework for analyzing polymorphism data sampled from multiallele systems.},

  abstract = {Most previous studies of the evolution of codon usage bias (CUB) and intronic GC content (iGC) in Drosophila melanogaster were based on between-species comparisons, reflecting long-term evolutionary events. However, a complete picture of the evolution of CUB and iGC cannot be drawn without knowledge of their more recent evolutionary history. Here, we used a polymorphism dataset collected from Zimbabwe to study patterns of the recent evolution of CUB and iGC. Analyzing coding and intronic data jointly with a model which can simultaneously estimate selection, mutational, and demographic parameters, we have found that: (1) natural selection is probably acting on synonymous codons; (2) a constant population size model seems to be sufficient to explain most of the observed synonymous polymorphism patterns; (3) GC is favored over AT in introns. In agreement with the long-term evolutionary patterns, ongoing selection acting on X-linked synonymous codons is stronger than that acting on autosomal codons. The selective differences between preferred and unpreferred codons tend to be greater than the differences between GC and AT in introns, suggesting that natural selection, not just biased gene conversion, may have influenced the evolution of CUB. Interestingly, evidence for non-equilibrium evolution comes exclusively from the intronic data. However, three different models, an equilibrium model with two classes of selected sites and two non-equilibrium models with changes in either population size or mutational parameters, fit the intronic data equally well. These results show that using inadequate selection (or demographic) models can result in incorrect estimates of demographic (or selection) parameters.},
