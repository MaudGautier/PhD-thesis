  abstract = {In mammals, genetic recombination during meiosis is limited to a set of 1- to 2-kb regions termed hotspots. Their locations are predominantly determined by the zinc finger protein PRDM9, which binds to DNA in hotspots and subsequently uses its SET domain to locally trimethylate histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3). This sets the stage for double-strand break (DSB) formation and reciprocal exchange of DNA between chromatids, forming Holliday junctions. Here we report genome-wide analyses of PRDM9-dependent histone modifications using two inbred mouse strains differing only in their PRDM9 zinc finger domain. We show that PRDM9 binding actively reorganizes nucleosomes into a symmetrical pattern, creating an extended nucleosome-depleted region. These regions are centered by a consensus PRDM9 binding motif, whose location and identity was confirmed in vitro. We also show that DSBs are centered over the PRDM9 binding motif within the nucleosome-depleted region. Combining these results with data from genetic crosses, we find that crossing-over is restricted to the region marked by H3K4me3. We suggest that PRDM9-modified nucleosomes create a permissible environment that first directs the location of DSBs and then defines the boundaries of Holliday junction branch migration.},

  abstract = {A dense map of genetic variation in the laboratory mouse genome will provide insights into the evolutionary history of the species1 and lead to an improved understanding of the relationship between inter-strain genotypic and phenotypic differences. Here we resequence the genomes of four wild-derived and eleven classical strains. We identify 8.27 million high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) densely distributed across the genome, and determine the locations of the high (divergent subspecies ancestry) and low (common subspecies ancestry) SNP-rate intervals2,3,4,5,6 for every pairwise combination of classical strains. Using these data, we generate a genome-wide haplotype map containing 40,898 segments, each with an average of three distinct ancestral haplotypes. For the haplotypes in the classical strains that are unequivocally assigned ancestry, the genetic contributions of the Mus musculus subspecies\textemdash{}M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus, M. m. castaneus and the hybrid M. m. molossinus\textemdash{}are 68\%, 6\%, 3\% and 10\%, respectively; the remaining 13\% of haplotypes are of unknown ancestral origin. The considerable regional redundancy of the SNP data will facilitate imputation of the majority of these genotypes in less-densely typed classical inbred strains to provide a complete view of variation in additional strains.},
