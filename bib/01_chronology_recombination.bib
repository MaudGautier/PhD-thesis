  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During Drosophila oogenesis, unrepaired double-strand DNA breaks activate a mei-41-dependent meiotic checkpoint, which couples the progression through meiosis to specific developmental processes. This checkpoint affects the accumulation of Gurken protein, a transforming growth factor alpha-like signaling molecule, as well as the morphology of the oocyte nucleus. However, the components of this checkpoint in flies have not been completely elucidated.
RESULTS: We show that a mutation in the Drosophila Chk2 homolog (DmChk2/Mnk) suppresses the defects in the translation of gurken mRNA and also the defects in oocyte nuclear morphology. We also found that DmChk2 is phosphorylated in a mei-41-dependent pathway. Analysis of the meiotic cell cycle progression shows that the Drosophila Chk2 homolog is not required during early meiotic prophase, as has been observed for Chk2 in C. elegans. We demonstrate that the activation of the meiotic checkpoint affects Dwee1 localization and is associated with DmChk2-dependent posttranslational modification of Dwee1. We suggest that Dwee1 has a role in the meiotic checkpoint that regulates the meiotic cell cycle, but not the translation of gurken mRNA. In addition, we found that p53 and mus304, the Drosophila ATR-IP homolog, are not required for the patterning defects caused by the meiotic DNA repair mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: DmChk2 is a transducer of the meiotic checkpoint in flies that is activated by unrepaired double-strand DNA breaks. Activation of DmChk2 in this specific checkpoint affects a cell cycle regulator as well as mRNA translation.},

  abstract = {We have recently shown that hypomorphic Mre11 complex mouse mutants exhibit defects in the repair of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs). This is associated with perturbation of synaptonemal complex morphogenesis, repair and regulation of crossover formation. To further assess the Mre11 complex's role in meiotic progression, we identified testis-specific NBS1-interacting proteins via two-hybrid screening in yeast. In this screen, Zip4h (Tex11), a male germ cell specific X-linked gene was isolated. Based on sequence and predicted structural similarity to the S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana Zip4 orthologs, ZIP4H appears to be the mammalian ortholog. In S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana, Zip4 is a meiosis-specific protein that regulates the level of meiotic crossovers, thus influencing homologous chromosome segregation in these organisms. As is true for hypomorphic Nbs1 (Nbs1(DeltaB/DeltaB)) mice, Zip4h(-/Y) mutant mice were fertile. Analysis of spermatocytes revealed a delay in meiotic double strand break repair and decreased crossover formation as inferred from DMC1 and MLH1 staining patterns, respectively. Achiasmate chromosomes at the first meiotic division were also observed in Zip4h(-/Y) mutants, consistent with the observed reduction in MLH1 focus formation. These results indicate that meiotic functions of Zip4 family members are conserved and support the view that the Mre11 complex and ZIP4H interact functionally during the execution of the meiotic program in mammals.},

Contrary to this expectation, we find that during meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, noncrossover heteroduplex products are formed at the same time as Holliday junction intermediates. Crossovers appear later, when these intermediates are resolved. Furthermore, noncrossover and crossover recombination are regulated differently. ndt80 mutants arrest in meiosis with unresolved Holliday junction intermediates and very few crossovers, while noncrossover heteroduplex products are formed at normal levels and with normal timing. These results suggest that crossovers are formed by resolution of Holliday junction intermediates, while most noncrossover recombinants arise by a different, earlier pathway.},

This heterochromatic body is transcriptionally silenced and marked by increased ubiquitination of histone H2A. This led us to investigate the relationship between histone H2A ubiquitination and chromatin silencing in more detail. First, we found that ubiquitinated H2A also marks the silenced X chromosome of the Barr body in female somatic cells. Next, we studied a possible relationship between H2A ubiquitination, chromatin silencing, and unpaired chromatin in meiotic prophase. The mouse models used carry an unpaired autosomal region in male meiosis or unpaired X and Y chromosomes in female meiosis. We show that ubiquitinated histone H2A is associated with transcriptional silencing of large chromatin regions. This silencing in mammalian meiotic prophase cells concerns unpaired chromatin regions and resembles a phenomenon described for the fungus Neurospora crassa and named meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA.},

There is also evidence for a strong association between duplication, genomic instability and large-scale chromosomal rearrangements. Exciting new findings suggest that SDs have not only created novel primate gene families, but might have also influenced current human genic and phenotypic variation on a previously unappreciated scale.

DMC1-deficient mice and yeast are sterile due to defective meiotic recombination and chromosome synapsis. The authors identified a male dominant sterile allele of Dmc1, Dmc1(Mei11), encoding a missense mutation in the L2 DNA binding domain that abolishes strand invasion activity. Meiosis in male heterozygotes arrests in pachynema, characterized by incomplete chromosome synapsis and no crossing-over. Young heterozygous females have normal litter sizes despite having a decreased oocyte pool, a high incidence of meiosis I abnormalities, and susceptibility to premature ovarian failure. Dmc1(Mei11) exposes a sex difference in recombination in that a significant portion of female oocytes can compensate for DMC1 deficiency to undergo crossing-over and complete gametogenesis. Importantly, these data demonstrate that dominant alleles of meiosis genes can arise and propagate in populations, causing infertility and other reproductive consequences due to meiotic prophase I defects.},

To understand the cellular response(s) that triggers apoptosis, we examined markers of spermatocyte development in mice with different recombination defects. In Spo11(-)(/)(-) mutants, which lack the double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate recombination, spermatocytes express markers of early to mid-pachynema, forming chromatin domains that contain sex body-associated proteins but that rarely encompass the sex chromosomes. Dmc1(-)(/)(-) spermatocytes, impaired in DSB repair, appear to arrest at or about late zygonema. Epistasis analysis reveals that this earlier arrest is a response to unrepaired DSBs, and cytological analysis implicates the BRCT-containing checkpoint protein TOPBP1. Atm(-)(/)(-) spermatocytes show similarities to Dmc1(-)(/)(-) spermatocytes, suggesting that ATM promotes meiotic DSB repair. Msh5(-)(/)(-) mutants display a set of characteristics distinct from these other mutants.

One key role of CO is to connect homologs before metaphase I and thus to ensure the proper reductional segregation. This role implies an accurate regulation of CO frequency with the establishment of at least one CO per chromosome arm. Current major challenges are to understand how CO and NCO formation are regulated and what is the role of NCO. We present here the current knowledge about CO and NCO and their regulation in mammals. CO density varies widely along chromosomes and their distribution is not random as they are subject to positive interference. As documented in the mouse and human, a significant excess of DSB are generated relative to the number of CO. In fact, evidence has been obtained for the formation of NCO products, for regulation of the choice of DSB repair towards CO or NCO and for a CO specific pathway. We discuss the roles of Msh4, Msh5 and Sycp1 which affect DSB repair and probably not only the CO pathway. We suggest that, in mammals, the regulation of NCO differs from that described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

In mice, SPO11 is strictly required for initiation of meiotic recombination and synapsis, yet SPO11 is still considered to be dispensable for sex-body formation in mouse spermatocytes. We provide conclusive evidence showing that functional SPO11, and consequently recombination and synapsis, are required for phosphorylation of H2AX in the X-Y chromatin and for sex-body formation in mouse spermatocytes. We investigated the role in meiosis of the three kinases [ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia- and Rad-3-related) and DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent-protein-kinase catalytic subunit)] known to phosphorylate H2AX in mitotic cells. We found that DNA-PKcs can be ruled out as an essential kinase in this process, whereas ATM is strictly required for the chromatin-wide phosphorylation of H2AX occurring in leptotene spermatocytes in response to DSBs. Remarkably, we discovered that Spo11 heterozygosity can rescue the prophase-I-arrest characteristic of ATM-deficient spermatocytes. Characterization of the rescued Atm-/- Spo11+/- mutant indicates that ATM is dispensable for sex-body formation and phosphorylation of H2AX in this subnuclear domain. The co-localization of ATR, phosphorylated H2AX and the sex chromatin observed in the Atm-/- Spo11+/- mutant, along with ATR transcription kinetics during the first wave of spermatogenesis, confirm and expand recent findings indicating that ATR is the kinase involved in H2AX phosphorylation in the sex body.},

Thus, the alternative splicing event must have emerged before the mouse and human lineages diverged and was maintained during 90 million years of evolution, arguing for an essential role for both isoforms. Here we demonstrate that developmental regulation of alternative splicing at the Spo11 locus governs the sequential expression of SPO11 isoforms in male meiotic prophase. Protein quantification in juvenile mice and in prophase mutants indicates that early spermatocytes synthesize primarily SPO11beta. Estimation of the number of SPO11 dimers (betabeta/alphabeta/alphaalpha) in mutants in which spermatocytes undergo a normal number of double strand breaks but arrest in midprophase due to inefficient repair argues for a role for SPO11beta-containing dimers in introducing the breaks in leptonema. Expression kinetics in males suggested a role for SPO11alpha in pachytene/diplotene spermatocytes. Nevertheless, we found that both alternative transcripts can be detected in oocytes throughout prophase I, arguing against a male-specific function for this isoform. Altogether, our data support a role for SPO11alpha in mid- to late prophase, presumably acting as a topoisomerase, that would be conserved in male and female meiocytes.},

  abstract = {Type II topoisomerases help regulate DNA topology during transcription, replication and recombination by catalysing DNA strand transfer through transient double-stranded breaks. All type II topoisomerases described so far are members of a single protein family. We have cloned and sequenced the genes encoding the A and B subunits of topoisomerase II from the archaeon Sulfolobus shibatae. This enzyme is the first of a new family. It has no similarity with other type II topoisomerases, except for three motifs in the B subunit probably involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. We also found these motifs in proteins of the Hsp90 and MutL families. The A subunit has similarities with four proteins of unknown function. One of them, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spo11 protein, is required for the initiation of meiotic recombination. Mutagenesis, performed on SPO11, of the single tyrosine conserved between the five homologues shows that this amino acid is essential for Spo11 activity. By analogy with the mechanism of action of known type II topoisomerases, we suggest that Spo11 catalyses the formation of double-strand breaks that initiate meiotic recombination in S. cerevisiae.},

  abstract = {During the first meiotic prophase, numerous DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are formed in the genome in order to initiate recombination between homologous chromosomes. The conserved Mre11 complex, formed of Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1 (Xrs2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) proteins, plays a crucial role in mitotic cells for sensing and repairing DSB. In meiosis the Mre11 complex is also required for meiotic recombination. Depending on the organisms, the Mre11 complex is required for the formation of the DSB catalysed by the transesterase Spo11 protein. It then plays a unique function in removing covalently attached Spo11 from the 5\textparagraph{} extremity of the breaks through its nuclease activity, to allow further break resection. Finally, the Mre11 complex also plays a role during meiosis in bridging DNA molecules together and in sensing Spo11 DSB and activating the DNA damage checkpoint. In this article the different biochemical functions of the Mre11 complex required during meiosis are reviewed, as well as the consequences of Mre11 complex inactivation for meiosis in several organisms. Finally, I describe the meiotic phenotypes of several animal models that have been developed to model hypomorphic mutations of the Mre11 complex, involved in humans in some genetic instability disorders.},

  abstract = {Defining the factors that lead to genomic instability is one of the most important fields in cancer biology. DNA damage can arise from exogenous sources or as a result of normal cellular metabolism. Regardless of the cause, when damaged DNA is not properly repaired the genome acquires mutation(s). Under normal circumstances, to prevent such chromosome instability the cell activates the checkpoint response, which inhibits cell cycle progression until DNA repair is complete. The Mre11 complex is formed by three components: Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1/Xrs2 and is involved in the signaling pathways that lead to both checkpoint activation and DNA repair. In response to DNA damage two functions of the complex will be discussed, one involves its role in initiating kinase activation and the second involves its ability to tether and link DNA strands. This review will highlight the functions of the Mre11 complex during the process of DNA double strand break recognition and repair, and during the process of replication. Understanding how the Mre11 complex is working at the molecular level is important for understanding why disruptions in components of the complex lead to genomic instability and cancer predisposition syndromes in humans.},

Among tetrads identified first as having a crossover in the interval, the average gene conversion tracts were apparently significantly shorter (0.71 +/- 1). We provide evidence that this apparent difference is due to the method of measuring conversion tracts and does not reflect a real difference in tract length. We also provide evidence that the number and position of restriction site markers alters the apparent distribution of the conversion tracts. More than ninety percent of the conversion tracts spanning three or more sites were continuous.},

We find that aged mother cells show a decreased ability to initiate the meiotic program and fail to express the meiotic inducer IME1. The few aged mother cells that do enter meiosis complete this developmental program but exhibit defects in meiotic chromosome segregation and spore formation. Furthermore, we find that mutations that extend replicative life span also extend the sexual reproductive life span. Our results indicate that in budding yeast, the ability to initiate and complete the meiotic program as well as the fidelity of meiotic chromosome segregation decrease with cellular age and are controlled by the same pathways that govern aging of asexually reproducing yeast cells.},

Although it was previously suggested that Neurospora may not require DSBs for synapsis, we report here that mutation of Neurospora spo11 disrupts meiosis, abolishing synapsis of homologous chromosomes during pachynema and resulting in ascospores that are frequently aneuploid and rarely viable. Alignment of homologues is partially restored after exposure of spo11 perithecia to ionising radiation. Crossing over in a spo11 mutant is reduced in two regions of the Neurospora genome as expected, but is unaffected in a third.},

HOP2-MND1 enhances the interaction of RAD51 with nucleotide cofactors and modifies its DNA-binding specificity in a manner that stimulates DNA strand exchange. It enables RAD51 DNA strand exchange in the absence of divalent metal ions required for ATP binding and offsets the effect of the K133A mutation that disrupts ATP binding. During nucleoprotein formation HOP2-MND1 helps to load RAD51 on ssDNA restricting its dsDNA-binding and during the homology search it promotes dsDNA binding removing the inhibitory effect of ssDNA.

Although the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase), ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), have all been implicated in H2AX phosphorylation, the specific kinase involved has not yet been identified. To definitively identify the specific kinase(s) that phosphorylates H2AX in vivo, we have utilized DNA-PKcs-/- and Atm-/- cell lines and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We find that H2AX phosphorylation and nuclear focus formation are normal in DNA-PKcs-/- cells and severely compromised in Atm-/- cells. We also find that ATM can phosphorylate H2AX in vitro and that ectopic expression of ATM in Atm-/- fibroblasts restores H2AX phosphorylation in vivo. The minimal H2AX phosphorylation in Atm-/- fibroblasts can be abolished by low concentrations of wortmannin suggesting that DNA-PK, rather than ATR, is responsible for low levels of H2AX phosphorylation in the absence of ATM. Our results clearly establish ATM as the major kinase involved in the phosphorylation of H2AX and suggest that ATM is one of the earliest kinases to be activated in the cellular response to double-strand breaks.},

The breaks observed in wild-type cells are similar to those identified independently at another recombination hot spot, ARG4. We show here that the breaks at ARG4 also occur in discrete form in rad50S mutants. Occurrence of breaks in rad50S mutants is also dependent upon SPO11 function. These observations provide additional evidence that double-strand breaks are a prominent feature of meiotic recombination in yeast. More importantly, these observations begin to define a pathway for the physical changes in DNA that lead to recombination and to define the roles of meiotic recombination functions in that pathway.},

We provide a comprehensive view on the organization of meiotic chromosomes and the mechanisms involved in the formation and genomic distribution of recombination hotspots, focusing on the factors influencing the formation and repair of the massive amount of self-induced DNA breaks in early stages of meiosis. At the same time, we discuss the genetic and mechanistic factors that influence recombination landscapes in mammals, as reflected by several layers of regulation. These factors include the selective forces that affect the DNA sequence itself, which can be modulated by genome reshuffling and the evolutionary history of each taxon, and the forces that control how the DNA is packaged into chromosomes during meiosis.},

  abstract = {In most meiotic systems, recombination is essential to form connections between homologs that ensure their accurate segregation from one another. Meiotic recombination is initiated by DNA double-strand breaks that are repaired using the homologous chromosome as a template. Studies of recombination in budding yeast have led to a model in which most early repair intermediates are disassembled to produce noncrossovers. Selected repair events are stabilized so they can proceed to form double-Holliday junction (dHJ) intermediates, which are subsequently resolved into crossovers. This model is supported in yeast by physical isolation of recombination intermediates, but the extent to which it pertains to animals is unknown. We sought to test this model in Drosophila melanogaster by analyzing patterns of heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) in recombination products. Previous attempts to do this have relied on knocking out the canonical mismatch repair (MMR) pathway, but in both yeast and Drosophila the resulting recombination products are complex and difficult to interpret. We show that, in Drosophila, this complexity results from a secondary, short-patch MMR pathway that requires nucleotide excision repair. Knocking out both canonical and short-patch MMR reveals hDNA patterns that reveal that many noncrossovers arise after both ends of the break have engaged with the homolog. Patterns of hDNA in crossovers could be explained by biased resolution of a dHJ; however, considering the noncrossover and crossover results together suggests a model in which a two-end engagement intermediate with unligated HJs can be disassembled by a helicase to a produce noncrossover or nicked by a nuclease to produce a crossover. While some aspects of this model are similar to the model from budding yeast, production of both noncrossovers and crossovers from a single, late intermediate is a fundamental difference that has important implications for crossover control.},

Meiotic progression must be prevented until DSB repair and homologue alignment are completed, to avoid the formation of aneuploid gametes. Here we show that mouse HORMAD1 ensures that sufficient numbers of processed DSBs are available for successful homology search. HORMAD1 is needed for normal synaptonemal-complex formation and for the efficient recruitment of ATR checkpoint kinase activity to unsynapsed chromatin. The latter phenomenon was proposed to be important in meiotic prophase checkpoints in both sexes. Consistent with this hypothesis, HORMAD1 is essential for the elimination of synaptonemal-complex-defective oocytes. Synaptonemal-complex formation results in HORMAD1 depletion from chromosome axes. Thus, we propose that the synaptonemal complex and HORMAD1 are key components of a negative feedback loop that coordinates meiotic progression with homologue alignment: HORMAD1 promotes homologue alignment and synaptonemal-complex formation, and synaptonemal complexes downregulate HORMAD1 function, thereby permitting progression past meiotic prophase checkpoints.},

To gain insight into the molecular mechanism involved in the formation of these DSBs, we have determined their positions at the nucleotide level at the CYS3 hot spot of gene conversion on chromosome I. We found four major new features of these DSBs: (i) sites of DSBs are multiple with varying intensities and spacing within the promoter region of the CYS3 gene; (ii) no consensus sequence can be found at these sites, indicating that the activity involved in DSB formation has little or no sequence specificity; (iii) the breaks are generated by blunt cleavages; and (iv) the 5' ends are modified in rad50S mutant strains, where the processing of these ends is known to be prevented.

The BLM helicase has been shown to maintain genome stability by preventing accumulation of aberrant recombination intermediates. We show here that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae BLM ortholog, Sgs1, plays an integral role in normal meiotic recombination, beyond its documented activity limiting aberrant recombination intermediates. In wild-type meiosis, temporally and mechanistically distinct pathways produce crossover and noncrossover recombinants. Crossovers form late in meiosis I prophase, by polo kinase-triggered resolution of Holliday junction (HJ) intermediates. Noncrossovers form earlier, via processes that do not involve stable HJ intermediates. In contrast, sgs1 mutants abolish early noncrossover formation. Instead, both noncrossovers and crossovers form by late HJ intermediate resolution, using an alternate pathway requiring the overlapping activities of Mus81-Mms4, Yen1, and~Slx1-Slx4, nucleases with minor roles in wild-type meiosis. We conclude that Sgs1 is a primary regulator of recombination pathway choice during meiosis and suggest a similar function in the mitotic cell cycle.},

The experimental system was designed for analysis of repair of an autonomously replicating plasmid containing a cloned gene disabled by an internal deletion. It was discovered that crossing over rarely accompanied gap repair. The strong bias against crossing over was observed in three different genes regardless of gap size. These results indicate that gap repair in U. maydis is unlikely to proceed by the mechanism envisioned in the double-stranded break repair model of recombination, which was developed to account for recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Experiments aimed at exploring processing of DNA ends were performed to gain understanding of the mechanism responsible for the observed bias. A heterologous insert placed within a gap in the coding sequence of two different marker genes strongly inhibited repair if the DNA was cleaved at the promoter-proximal junction joining the insert and coding sequence but had little effect on repair if the DNA was cleaved at the promoter-distal junction. Gene conversion of plasmid restriction fragment length polymorphism markers engineered in sequences flanking both sides of a gap accompanied repair but was directionally biased. These results are interpreted to mean that the DNA ends flanking a gap are subject to different types of processing. A model featuring a single migrating D-loop is proposed to explain the bias in gap repair outcome based on the observed asymmetry in processing the DNA ends.},

METHODS: We used immunofluorescent techniques to examine recombination (MLH1), synapsis (SYCP3/SYCP1) and transcriptional inactivation (BRCA1/gammaH2AX/RNA polymerase II) of meiotic chromosomes in an azoospermic carrier of a t(8;13) reciprocal translocation. Two biopsies were performed 1 year apart and on different testes.
RESULTS: Global recombination rates differed between the two biopsies. Although global recombination rates were not altered when compared with control men, recombination frequencies were reduced specifically on the rearranged chromosomes. Asynapsed quadrivalents were observed in 90\% and 87\% of pachytene nuclei from the first and second biopsies, respectively, and were frequently associated with the sex chromosomes. BRCA1 and gammaH2AX, two proteins implicated in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, localized along asynapsed regions regardless of whether or not they were associated with the sex chromosomes. Immunostaining for RNA polymerase II provided further evidence that unsynapsed regions are silenced during human meiosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The fidelity of synapsis is a critical factor in determining the outcome of gametogenesis in humans, as the transcriptional inactivation of asynapsed regions may silence meiotic genes, leading to meiotic arrest and infertility.},

To assess the nature and stringency of constraints on human recombination, we examined crossover patterns in transmissions to viable, non-trisomic offspring, using dense genotyping data collected in a large set of pedigrees. Our analysis supports a requirement for one chiasma per chromosome rather than per arm to ensure proper disjunction, with additional chiasmata occurring in proportion to physical length. The requirement is not absolute, however, as chromosome 21 seems to be frequently transmitted properly in the absence of a chiasma in females, a finding that raises the possibility of a back-up mechanism aiding in its correct segregation. We also found a set of double crossovers in surprisingly close proximity, as expected from a second pathway that is not subject to crossover interference. These findings point to multiple mechanisms that shape the distribution of crossovers, influencing proper disjunction in humans., In humans, as in most sexually reproducing organisms, recombination plays a fundamental role in meiosis, helping to align chromosomes and to ensure their proper segregation. Recombination events are tightly regulated both in terms of their minimum number (the rule of ``crossover assurance'') and placement (due to ``crossover interference''). Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that recombination patterns are highly variable among humans, raising numerous questions about the nature and stringency of crossover assurance and interference. We took a first step towards answering these questions by examining patterns of recombination in gametes inherited by viable, non-trisomic offspring. We found that the minimum number of crossovers is tightly regulated at the level of a chromosome (rather than chromosome arm), but with a notable exception: in females, chromosome 21 appears to frequently segregate properly in the absence of a crossover. We also found a set of double recombination events in surprisingly close proximity, consistent with a pathway not subject to crossover interference. These findings suggest that there are multiple mechanisms of recombination in human meiosis, which may buffer the effects of inter-individual variation in rates.},

Moreover, the combination of immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridisation has enabled us to construct recombination maps of primate chromosomes that are homologous to human chromosomes 13 and 21. Our results show that (a) the overall number of MLH1 foci varies among all three species, (b) the presence of heterochromatin blocks does not have a major influence on the distribution of MLH1 foci and (c) the distribution of crossovers in the homologous chromosomes to human chromosomes 13 and 21 are conserved between species of the same genus (C. libidinosus and C. nigritus) but are significantly different between Cebus and Alouatta.

In each meiotic cell, recombination is initiated by numerous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) created by Spo11, the evolutionarily conserved topoisomerase-like protein, but how these DSBs are distributed relatively uniformly across the four chromatids that make up each chromosome pair is poorly understood. Here we employ Saccharomyces cerevisiae to demonstrate distance-dependent DSB interference in cis (in which the occurrence of a DSB suppresses adjacent DSB formation)--a process that is mediated by the conserved DNA damage response kinase, Tel1(ATM). The inhibitory function of Tel1 acts on a relatively local scale, while over large distances DSBs have a tendency to form independently of one another even in the presence of Tel1. Notably, over very short distances, loss of Tel1 activity causes DSBs to cluster within discrete zones of concerted DSB activity. Our observations support a hierarchical view of recombination initiation where Tel1(ATM) prevents clusters of DSBs, and further suppresses DSBs within the surrounding chromosomal region. Such collective negative regulation will help to ensure that recombination events are dispersed evenly and arranged optimally for genetic exchange and efficient chromosome segregation.},

  abstract = {Faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis requires that homologous chromosomes associate and recombine. Chiasmata, the cytological manifestation of recombination, provide the physical link that holds the homologs together as a pair, facilitating their orientation on the spindle at meiosis I. Formation of most crossover (CO) events requires the assistance of a group of proteins collectively known as ZMM. HFM1/Mer3 is in this group of proteins and is required for normal progression of homologous recombination and proper synapsis between homologous chromosomes in a number of model organisms. Our work is the first study in mammals showing the in vivo function of mouse HFM1. Cytological observations suggest that initial steps of recombination are largely normal in a majority of Hfm1(-/-) spermatocytes. Intermediate and late stages of recombination appear aberrant, as chromosomal localization of MSH4 is altered and formation of MLH1foci is drastically reduced. In agreement, chiasma formation is reduced, and cells arrest with subsequent apoptosis at diakinesis. Our results indicate that deletion of Hfm1 leads to the elimination of a major fraction but not all COs. Formation of chromosome axial elements and homologous pairing is apparently normal, and Hfm1(-/-) spermatocytes progress to the end of prophase I without apparent developmental delay or apoptosis. However, synapsis is altered with components of the central region of the synaptonemal complex frequently failing to extend the full length of the chromosome axes. We propose that initial steps of recombination are sufficient to support homology recognition, pairing, and initial chromosome synapsis and that HFM1 is required to form normal numbers of COs and to complete synapsis.},

Studies in a number of organisms have unveiled the existence of surveillance mechanisms or checkpoints that couple the formation and repair of DSBs to cell cycle progression. Through these mechanisms, aberrant meiocytes are delayed in their meiotic progression, thereby facilitating repair of meiotic DSBs, or are culled through programmed cell death, thereby protecting the germline from aneuploidies that could lead to spontaneous abortions, birth defects and cancer predisposition in the offspring. Here we summarize recent progress in our understanding of these checkpoints.

Mammalian MUS81 has been implicated in maintenance of genomic stability in somatic cells; however, little is known about its role during meiosis. Mus81-deficient mice were originally reported as being viable and fertile, with normal meiotic progression; however, a more detailed examination of meiotic progression in Mus81-null animals and WT controls reveals significant meiotic defects in the mutants. These include smaller testis size, a depletion of mature epididymal sperm, significantly upregulated accumulation of MLH1 on chromosomes from pachytene meiocytes in an interference-independent fashion, and a subset of meiotic DSBs that fail to be repaired. Interestingly, chiasmata numbers in spermatocytes from Mus81-/- animals are normal, suggesting additional integrated mechanisms controlling the two distinct crossover pathways. This study is the first in-depth analysis of meiotic progression in Mus81-nullizygous mice, and our results implicate the MUS81 pathway as a regulator of crossover frequency and placement in mammals.},

BS mutated (Blm), the gene mutated in BS patients, is one of five mammalian RecQ helicases. Although BLM has been shown to promote genome stability by assisting in the repair of DNA structures that arise during homologous recombination in somatic cells, less is known about its role in meiotic recombination primarily because of the embryonic lethality associated with Blm deletion. However, the localization of BLM protein on meiotic chromosomes together with evidence from yeast and other organisms implicates a role for BLM helicase in meiotic recombination events, prompting us to explore the meiotic phenotype of mice bearing a conditional mutant allele of Blm. In this study, we show that BLM deficiency does not affect entry into prophase I but causes severe defects in meiotic progression. This is exemplified by improper pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes and altered processing of recombination intermediates, resulting in increased chiasmata. Our data provide the first analysis of BLM function in mammalian meiosis and strongly argue that BLM is involved in proper pairing, synapsis, and segregation of homologous chromosomes; however, it is dispensable for the accumulation of recombination intermediates.},

We have analyzed the relationship between homologous recombination and crossing-over in haploid budding yeast and identified factors involved in the regulation of crossover outcomes. Gene conversions unaccompanied by a crossover appear 30 min before conversions accompanied by exchange, indicating that there are two different repair mechanisms in mitotic cells. Crossovers are rare (5\%), but deleting the BLM/WRN homolog, SGS1, or the SRS2 helicase increases crossovers 2- to 3-fold. Overexpressing SRS2 nearly eliminates crossovers, whereas overexpression of RAD51 in srs2Delta cells almost completely eliminates the noncrossover recombination pathway. We suggest Sgs1 and its associated topoisomerase Top3 remove double Holliday junction intermediates from a crossover-producing repair pathway, thereby reducing crossovers. Srs2 promotes the noncrossover synthesis-dependent strand-annealing (SDSA) pathway, apparently by regulating Rad51 binding during strand exchange.},

Ishiguro et al. now show that homolog recognition in spermatocytes starts in early meiotic prophase. Intriguingly, meiosis-specific cohesin plays an essential role in homolog recognition far prior to DNA double-strand break formation. The findings suggest the possibility that homolog recognition is achieved primarily by searching for homology in the chromosome architecture as defined by meiosis-specific cohesin rather than the DNA sequence itself., During meiosis, homologous chromosome (homolog) pairing is promoted by several layers of regulation that include dynamic chromosome movement and meiotic recombination. However, the way in which homologs recognize each other remains a fundamental issue in chromosome biology. Here, we show that homolog recognition or association initiates upon entry into meiotic prophase before axis assembly and double-strand break (DSB) formation. This homolog association develops into tight pairing only during or after axis formation. Intriguingly, the ability to recognize homologs is retained in Sun1 knockout spermatocytes, in which telomere-directed chromosome movement is abolished, and this is the case even in Spo11 knockout spermatocytes, in which DSB-dependent DNA homology search is absent. Disruption of meiosis-specific cohesin RAD21L precludes the initial association of homologs as well as the subsequent pairing in spermatocytes. These findings suggest the intriguing possibility that homolog recognition is achieved primarily by searching for homology in the chromosome architecture as defined by meiosis-specific cohesin rather than in the DNA sequence itself.},

We show here that both meiotic prophase timing and germ-line apoptosis, one output of checkpoint signaling, are dictated by the sex of the germ line (oogenesis vs. spermatogenesis) in Caenorhabditis elegans. During oogenesis in feminized animals (fem-3), a single pair of asynapsed autosomes elicits a checkpoint response, yet an unpaired X chromosome fails to induce checkpoint activation. The single X in males and fem-3 worms is a substrate for the meiotic recombination machinery and repair of the resulting double strand breaks appears to be delayed compared with worms carrying paired X chromosomes. Synaptonemal complex axial HORMA domain proteins, implicated in repair of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs) and checkpoint function, are assembled and disassembled on the single X similarly to paired chromosomes, but the central region component, SYP-1, is not loaded on the X chromosome in males. In fem-3 worms some X chromosomes achieve nonhomologous self-synapsis; however, germ cells with SYP-1-positive X chromosomes are not preferentially protected from apoptosis. Analyses of chromatin and X-linked gene expression indicate that a single X, unlike asynapsed X chromosomes or autosomes, maintains repressive chromatin marks and remains transcriptionally silenced and suggests that this state locally precludes checkpoint signaling.},

However little is known about the mechanisms driving species-specific DSBs. This study by Kauppi et al. provides evidence that successful homolog synapsis in mouse spermatocytes requires a high number of DSBs. The authors discover that small autosomes and heteromorphic sex chromosomes are weak links whose pairing requirements set the lower limit for DSB levels. This study shows that the karyotypic structure impinges on the interplay between pairing and recombination during meiosis., Different organisms display widely different numbers of the programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination (e.g., hundreds per meiocyte in mice and humans vs. dozens in nematodes), but little is known about what drives these species-specific DSB set points or the regulatory pathways that control them. Here we examine male mice with a lowered dosage of SPO11, the meiotic DSB catalyst, to gain insight into the effect of reduced DSB numbers on mammalian chromosome dynamics. An approximately twofold DSB reduction was associated with the reduced ability of homologs to synapse along their lengths, provoking prophase arrest and, ultimately, sterility. In many spermatocytes, chromosome subsets displayed a mix of synaptic failure and synapsis with both homologous and nonhomologous partners (``chromosome tangles''). The X chromosome was nearly always involved in tangles, and small autosomes were involved more often than large ones. We conclude that homolog pairing requirements dictate DSB set points during meiosis. Importantly, our results reveal that karyotype is a key factor: Smaller autosomes and heteromorphic sex chromosomes become weak links when DSBs are reduced below a critical threshold. Unexpectedly, unsynapsed chromosome segments trapped in tangles displayed an elevated density of DSB markers later in meiotic prophase. The unsynapsed portion of the X chromosome in wild-type males also showed evidence that DSB numbers increased as prophase progressed. These findings point to the existence of a feedback mechanism that links DSB number and distribution with interhomolog interactions.},

In certain mutants, breaks accumulate with a covalently attached protein, suggesting that cleavage is catalyzed by the DSB-associated protein via a topoisomerase-like transesterase mechanism. We have purified these protein-DNA complexes and identified the protein as Spo11, one of several proteins required for DSB formation. These findings strongly implicate Spo11 as the catalytic subunit of the meiotic DNA cleavage activity. This is the first identification of a biochemical function for any of the gene products involved in DSB formation. Spo11 defines a protein family with other members in fission yeast, nematodes, and archaebacteria. The S. pombe homolog, rec12p, is also known to be required for meiotic recombination. Thus, these findings provide direct evidence that the mechanism of meiotic recombination initiation is evolutionarily conserved.},

Pol {$\beta$} localizes to synapsed axes during zygonema and pachynema, and it associates with the ends of bivalents during late pachynema and diplonema. To test whether these localization patterns reflect a function for Pol {$\beta$} in recombination and/or synapsis, we used conditional gene targeting to delete the PolB gene from germ cells. We find that Pol {$\beta$}-deficient spermatocytes are defective in meiotic chromosome synapsis and undergo apoptosis during Prophase I. We also find that SPO11-dependent {$\gamma$}H2AX persists on meiotic chromatin, indicating that Pol {$\beta$} is critical for the repair of SPO11-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs). Pol {$\beta$}-deficient spermatocytes yielded reduced steady-state levels of the SPO11-oligonucleotide complexes that are formed when SPO11 is removed from the ends of DSBs, and cytological experiments revealed that chromosome-associated foci of replication protein A (RPA), RAD51 and DMC1 are less abundant in Pol {$\beta$}-deficient spermatocyte nuclei. Localization of Pol {$\beta$} to meiotic chromosomes requires the formation of SPO11-dependent DSBs. Taken together, these findings strongly indicate that Pol {$\beta$} is required at a very early step in the processing of meiotic DSBs, at or before the removal of SPO11 from DSB ends and the generation of the 3{${'}$} single-stranded tails necessary for subsequent strand exchange. The chromosome synapsis defects and Prophase I apoptosis of Pol {$\beta$}-deficient spermatocytes are likely a direct consequence of these recombination defects.},

We demonstrate that MSH4 is present in the nuclei of spermatocytes early in prophase I and that it forms discrete foci along meiotic chromosomes during the zygotene and pachytene stages of meiosis. Disruption of the Msh4 gene in mice results in male and female sterility due to meiotic failure.

Studies in yeast have shown that DSB formation requires several other proteins, the role and conservation of which remain unknown. Here we show that two of these Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, Mei4 and Rec114, are evolutionarily conserved in most eukaryotes. Mei4(-/-) mice are deficient in meiotic DSB formation, thus showing the functional conservation of Mei4 in mice. Cytological analyses reveal that, in mice, MEI4 is localized in discrete foci on the axes of meiotic chromosomes that do not overlap with DMC1 and RPA foci. We thus propose that MEI4 acts as a structural component of the DSB machinery that ensures meiotic DSB formation on chromosome axes. We show that mouse MEI4 and REC114 proteins interact directly, and we identify conserved motifs as required for this interaction. Finally, the unexpected, concomitant absence of Mei4 and Rec114, as well as of Mnd1, Hop2, and Dmc1, in some eukaryotic species (particularly Neurospora crassa, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans) suggests the existence of Mei4-Rec114-dependent and Mei4-Rec114-independent mechanisms for DSB formation, and a functional relationship between the chromosome axis and DSB formation.},

Here, we show that HORMAD1, one of the meiotic chromosome axis components, is required for MEI4 localization. Importantly, the quantitative correlation between the level of axis-associated MEI4 and DSB formation suggests that axis-associated MEI4 could be a limiting factor for DSB formation. We also show that MEI1, REC8 and RAD21L are important for proper MEI4 localization. These findings on MEI4 dynamics during meiotic prophase suggest that the association of MEI4 to chromosome axes is required for DSB formation, and that the loss of this association upon DSB repair could contribute to turning off meiotic DSB formation.},

  abstract = {In many organisms, developmentally programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) formed by the SPO11 transesterase initiate meiotic recombination, which promotes pairing and segregation of homologous chromosomes. Because every chromosome must receive a minimum number of DSBs, attention has focused on factors that support DSB formation. However, improperly repaired DSBs can cause meiotic arrest or mutation; thus, having too many DSBs is probably as deleterious as having too few. Only a small fraction of SPO11 protein ever makes a DSB in yeast or mouse and SPO11 and its accessory factors remain abundant long after most DSB formation ceases, implying the existence of mechanisms that restrain SPO11 activity to limit DSB numbers. Here we report that the number of meiotic DSBs in mouse is controlled by ATM, a kinase activated by DNA damage to trigger checkpoint signalling and promote DSB repair. Levels of SPO11-oligonucleotide complexes, by-products of meiotic DSB formation, are elevated at least tenfold in spermatocytes lacking ATM. Moreover, Atm mutation renders SPO11-oligonucleotide levels sensitive to genetic manipulations that modulate SPO11 protein levels. We propose that ATM restrains SPO11 via a negative feedback loop in which kinase activation by DSBs suppresses further DSB formation. Our findings explain previously puzzling phenotypes of Atm-null mice and provide a molecular basis for the gonadal dysgenesis observed in ataxia telangiectasia, the human syndrome caused by ATM deficiency.},

In this article we investigate the functions of the remaining three proteins\textemdash{}Mer2, Mei4, and Rec114\textemdash{}with particular emphasis on Mer2. The Mer2 protein is present in vegetative cells, but it increases in abundance and becomes phosphorylated specifically during meiotic prophase. Mer2 localizes to distinct foci on meiotic chromosomes, with foci maximally abundant prior to the formation of synaptonemal complex. If DSB formation is blocked (e.g., by a spo11 mutation), dephosphorylation of Mer2 and its dissociation from chromosomes are delayed. We have also found that the Mei4 and Rec114 proteins localize to foci on chromosomes and these foci partially colocalize with each other and with Mer2. Furthermore, the three proteins co-immunoprecipitate. Mer2 does not show significant colocalization with Mre11 or Rec102 and Mer2 does not co-immunoprecipitate with Rec102.

As in most eukaryotes, mammalian meiocytes have checkpoints that monitor the fidelity of these processes. We report that the mouse ortholog (Trip13) of pachytene checkpoint 2 (PCH2), an essential component of the synapsis checkpoint in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans, is required for completion of meiosis in both sexes. TRIP13-deficient mice exhibit spermatocyte death in pachynema and loss of oocytes around birth. The chromosomes of mutant spermatocytes synapse fully, yet retain several markers of recombination intermediates, including RAD51, BLM, and RPA. These chromosomes also exhibited the chiasmata markers MLH1 and MLH3, and okadaic acid treatment of mutant spermatocytes caused progression to metaphase I with bivalent chromosomes. Double mutant analysis demonstrated that the recombination and synapsis genes Spo11, Mei1, Rec8, and Dmc1 are all epistatic to Trip13, suggesting that TRIP13 does not have meiotic checkpoint function in mice. Our data indicate that TRIP13 is required after strand invasion for completing a subset of recombination events, but possibly not those destined to be crossovers. To our knowledge, this is the first model to separate recombination defects from asynapsis in mammalian meiosis, and provides the first evidence that unrepaired DNA damage alone can trigger the pachytene checkpoint response in mice.},

Nevertheless, unlike arrested spermatocytes, a small number of mutant oocytes proved capable of progressing to metaphase I and attempting the first meiotic division. However, their chromosomes were unpaired and were not organized properly at the metaphase plate or along the spindle fibers during segregation. mei1 was genetically mapped to chromosome (Chr) 15 in an interval that is syntenic to human Chr 22q13.

Homozygotes of both sexes are sterile due to meiotic arrest caused by defects in chromosome synapsis.

Here, we show that treatment of mutant males with cisplatin restores RAD51 loading, suggesting that mutant spermatocytes have intact recombinational repair mechanisms. Levels of histone H2AX phosphorylation (gammaH2AX) at leptonema are significantly reduced compared with wild-type controls but comparable to that seen in animals deficient for SPO11, the molecule required for catalyzing DSB formation during meiosis. These observations provide evidence that genetically programmed DSB induction is defective in Mei1 leptotene spermatocytes. We also report the positional cloning of Mei1, which encodes a product without significant homology to any known protein. Expressed almost exclusively in gonads, Mei1 has no apparent homologs in yeast, worms, or flies. However, Mei1 orthologs are present in the genomes of mammals, chickens, and zebrafish.

  abstract = {MutL homolog 3 (Mlh3) is a member of a family of proteins conserved during evolution and having dual roles in DNA mismatch repair and meiosis. The pathway in eukaryotes consists of the DNA-binding components, which are the homologs of the bacterial MutS protein (MSH 2 6), and the MutL homologs, which bind to the MutS homologs and are essential for the repair process. Three of the six homologs of MutS that function in these processes, Msh2, Msh3 and Msh6, are involved in the mismatch repair of mutations, frameshifts and replication errors, and two others, Msh4 and Msh5, have specific roles in meiosis. Of the four MutL homologs, Mlh1, Mlh3, Pms1 and Pms2, three are involved in mismatch repair and at least two, Pms2 and Mlh1, are essential for meiotic progression in both yeast and mice. To assess the role of Mlh3 in mammalian meiosis, we have generated and characterized Mlh3(-/-) mice. Here we show that Mlh3(-/-) mice are viable but sterile. Mlh3 is required for Mlh1 binding to meiotic chromosomes and localizes to meiotic chromosomes from the mid pachynema stage of prophase I. Mlh3(-/-) spermatocytes reach metaphase before succumbing to apoptosis, but oocytes fail to complete meiosis I after fertilization. Our results show that Mlh3 has an essential and distinct role in mammalian meiosis.},

We established mRad50 mutant mice to examine the role of the mammalian Mre11/Rad50 protein complex in the DNA damage response. Early embryonic cells deficient in mRad50 are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation, consistent with a role for this complex in the repair of ionizing radiation-induced DSBs.

Mcm8(-/-) and Mcm9(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts show growth defects and chromosomal damage and cannot overcome a transient inhibition of replication fork progression. In these cells, chromatin recruitment of HR factors like Rad51 and RPA is impaired and HR strongly reduced. We further demonstrate that MCM8 and MCM9 form a complex and that they coregulate their stability.

Unrepaired DSBs are thought to trigger apoptosis during midpachytene of male meiosis if synapsis fails. An early pachytene response to asynapsis is meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC), which, in normal males, silences the X and Y chromosomes (meiotic sex chromosome inactivation [MSCI]). In this study, we show that MSUC occurs in Spo11-null mouse spermatocytes with extensive asynapsis but lacking meiotic DSBs. In contrast, three mutants (Dnmt3l, Msh5, and Dmc1) with high levels of asynapsis and numerous persistent unrepaired DSBs have a severely impaired MSUC response. We suggest that MSUC-related proteins, including the MSUC initiator BRCA1, are sequestered at unrepaired DSBs. All four mutants fail to silence the X and Y chromosomes (MSCI failure), which is sufficient to explain the midpachytene apoptosis. Apoptosis does not occur in mice with a single additional asynapsed chromosome with unrepaired meiotic DSBs and no disturbance of MSCI.},

  abstract = {In most sexually reproducing organisms, meiotic recombination is initiated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) formed by the Spo11 protein. In budding yeast, nine other proteins are also required for DSB formation, but the roles of these proteins and the interactions among them are poorly understood. We report further studies of the behaviors of these proteins. Consistent with other studies, we find that Mei4 and Rec114 bind to chromosomes from leptonema through early pachynema. Both proteins showed only limited colocalization with the meiotic cohesin subunit Rec8, suggesting that Mei4 and Rec114 associated preferentially with chromatin loops. Rec114 localization was independent of other DSB factors, but Mei4 localization was strongly dependent on Rec114 and Mer2. Systematic deletion analysis identified protein regions important for a previously described two-hybrid interaction between Mei4 and Rec114. We also report functional characterization of a previously misannotated 5' coding exon of REC102. Sequences encoded in this exon are essential for DSB formation and for Rec102 interaction with Rec104, Spo11, Rec114, and Mei4. Finally, we also examined genetic requirements for a set of previously described two-hybrid interactions that can be detected only when the reporter strain is induced to enter meiosis. This analysis reveals new functional dependencies for interactions among the DSB proteins. Taken together, these studies support the view that Mei4, Rec114, and Mer2 make up a functional subgroup that is distinct from other subgroups of the DSB proteins: Spo11-Ski8, Rec102-Rec104, and Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2. These studies also suggest that an essential function of Rec102 and Rec104 is to connect Mei4 and Rec114 to Spo11.},

  abstract = {Spo11 is a meiotic protein of fundamental importance as it is a conserved meiosis-specific transesterase required for meiotic recombination initiation in fungi, animals, and plants. Spo11 is homologous to the archaebacterial topoisomerase VIA (Top6A) gene, and its homologs are broadly distributed among eukaryotes, with some eukaryotes having more than one homolog. However, the evolutionary relationships among these genes are unclear, with some debate as to whether eukaryotic homologs originated by lateral gene transfer. We have identified and characterized protist Spo11 homologs by degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing and by analyses of sequences from public databases. Our phylogenetic analyses show that Spo11 homologs evolved by two ancient eukaryotic gene duplication events prior to the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes, resulting in three eukaryotic paralogs: Spo11-1, Spo11-2, and Spo11-3. Spo11-1 orthologs encode meiosis-specific proteins and are distributed broadly among eukaryotic lineages, though Spo11-1 is absent from some protists. This absence coincides with the presence of Spo11-2 orthologs, which are meiosis-specific in Arabidopsis and are found in plants, red algae, and some protists but absent in animals and fungi. Spo11-3 encodes a Top6A subunit that interacts with topoisomerase VIB (Top6B) subunits, which together play a role in vegetative growth in Arabidopsis. We identified Spo11-3 (Top6A) and Top6B homologs in plants, red algae, and a few protists, establishing a broader distribution of these genes among eukaryotes, indicating their likely vertical descent followed by lineage-specific loss.},

  abstract = {Meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate crossover (CO) recombination, which is necessary for accurate chromosome segregation, but DSBs may also repair as non-crossovers (NCOs). Multiple recombination pathways with specific intermediates are expected to lead to COs and NCOs. We revisited the mechanisms of meiotic DSB repair and the regulation of CO formation, by conducting a genome-wide analysis of strand-transfer intermediates associated with recombination events. We performed this analysis in a SK1 \texttimes{} S288C Saccharomyces cerevisiae hybrid lacking the mismatch repair (MMR) protein Msh2, to allow efficient detection of heteroduplex DNAs (hDNAs). First, we observed that the anti-recombinogenic activity of MMR is responsible for a 20\% drop in CO number, suggesting that in MMR-proficient cells some DSBs are repaired using the sister chromatid as a template when polymorphisms are present. Second, we observed that a large fraction of NCOs were associated with trans-hDNA tracts constrained to a single chromatid. This unexpected finding is compatible with dissolution of double Holliday junctions (dHJs) during repair, and it suggests the existence of a novel control point for CO formation at the level of the dHJ intermediate, in addition to the previously described control point before the dHJ formation step. Finally, we observed that COs are associated with complex hDNA patterns, confirming that the canonical double-strand break repair model is not sufficient to explain the formation of most COs. We propose that multiple factors contribute to the complexity of recombination intermediates. These factors include repair of nicks and double-stranded gaps, template switches between non-sister and sister chromatids, and HJ branch migration. Finally, the good correlation between the strand transfer properties observed in the absence of and in the presence of Msh2 suggests that the intermediates detected in the absence of Msh2 reflect normal intermediates.},

The MER3 gene is known to affect selectively crossover, but not noncrossover, recombination. The Mer3 protein is a DNA helicase that unwinds duplex DNA in the 3' to 5' direction. To define the underlying molecular steps of meiotic recombination, we investigated the role of Mer3 helicase in DNA strand exchange promoted by Rad51 protein. We found that Mer3 helicase does not function as an initiator of DNA pairing events but, rather, it stimulates DNA heteroduplex extension in the 3' --{$>$} 5' direction relative to the incoming (or displaced) single-stranded DNA. Conversely, Mer3 helicase blocks DNA heteroduplex extension in the 5' --{$>$} 3' direction. Our results support the idea that Mer3 helicase stabilizes nascent joint molecules via DNA heteroduplex extension to permit capture of the second processed end of a double-stranded DNA break, a step which is required for crossover recombinant product formation.},

Genetic studies in D. melanogaster have shown that the mei-W68 gene is required for all meiotic gene conversion and crossing-over. We cloned mei-W68 using a new genetic mapping method in which P elements are used to promote crossing-over at their insertion sites. This resulted in the high-resolution mapping of mei-W68 to a {$<$}18-kb region that contains a homolog of the S. cerevisiae spo11 gene. Molecular analysis of several mutants confirmed that mei-W68 encodes an spo11 homolog. Spo11 and MEI-W68 are members of a family of proteins similar to a novel type II topoisomerase. On the basis of this and other lines of evidence, Spo11 has been proposed to be the enzymatic activity that creates the double-strand breaks needed to initiate meiotic recombination. This raises the possibility that recombination in Drosophila is also initiated by double-strand breaks. Although these homologous genes are required absolutely for recombination in both species, their roles differ in other respects. In contrast to spo11, mei-W68 is not required for synaptonemal complex formation and does have a mitotic role.},

Double Holliday junction (dHJ) intermediates were previously proposed to form both reciprocal crossover recombinants (COs) and noncrossover recombinants (NCOs); however, dHJs are now thought to give rise mainly to COs, with SDSA forming most or all NCOs. To test this model in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we constructed a random spore system in which it is possible to identify a subset of NCO recombinants that can readily be accounted for by SDSA, but not by dHJ-mediated recombination. The diagnostic class of recombinants is one in which two markers on opposite sides of a double-strand break site are converted, without conversion of an intervening heterologous insertion located on the donor chromatid. This diagnostic class represents 26\% of selected NCO recombinants. Tetrad analysis using the same markers provided additional evidence that SDSA is a major pathway for NCO gene conversion in meiosis.},

Here, we report the identification of a Mus musculus Spo11 cDNA, which encodes a protein closely related to all members of the SPO11/TOPVIA family. cDNAs resulting from alternative splicing were detected, suggesting that there are potential variants of the mouse SPO11 protein. By RNA-blotting analysis, expression of the mouse Spo11 gene was detected only in the testis, in agreement with its predicted function in the initiation of meiotic recombination.

For groups A, B, and C most trisomies arise by a process independent of maternal age. A small proportion of these trisomies and about half of trisomies for smaller chromosomes (excluding trisomies 16 and perhaps 22) originate by some process dependent on maternal (but not paternal) age and therefore presumably independent of crossingover, which in the female takes place before birth.},

However, mice that harbor hypomorphic Brca1 and Brca2 alleles and cre-mediated tissue-specific deletions for Brca1 and Brca2 have been generated. Mice deficient for either Brca1 or Brca2 sustain a wide range of carcinoma and mammary epithelium deleted for Brca1 or Brca2 is highly susceptible to mammary tumorigenesis. Mammary (and other) tumors occur at long latency as compared to oncogene-induced mouse tumors. p53 deficiency is highly cooperative with both Brca1 and Brca2 in promoting tumorigenesis. Analysis of Brca1-associated mammary tumors reveals significant similarities to BRCA1-associated breast cancer in regard to high tumor grade, hormone receptor negativity, a high incidence of p53 mutations and genetic instability.},

An in vitro-constructed deletion was also copied into white at high frequencies. This procedure can be applied to the study of gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster, especially for genes too large to be manipulated in other ways. We also observed several types of more complex events in which the copied template sequences were rearranged such that the breakpoints occurred at direct duplications. Most of these can be explained by a model of double strand break repair in which each terminus of the break invades a template independently and serves as a primer for DNA synthesis from it, yielding two overlapping single-stranded sequences. These single strands then pair, and synthesis is completed by each using the other as a template. This synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) model as a possible general mechanism in complex organisms is discussed.},

The Spo11 protein must be removed for the DSB to be repaired, but the mechanism for removal is unclear. Here we show that meiotic DSBs in budding yeast are processed by endonucleolytic cleavage that releases Spo11 attached to an oligonucleotide with a free 3'-OH. Two discrete Spo11-oligonucleotide complexes were found in equal amounts, differing with respect to the length of the bound DNA. We propose that these forms arise from different spacings of strand cleavages flanking the DSB, with every DSB processed asymmetrically. Thus, the ends of a single DSB may be biochemically distinct at or before the initial processing step-much earlier than previously thought. SPO11-oligonucleotide complexes were identified in extracts of mouse testis, indicating that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Oligonucleotide-topoisomerase II complexes were also present in extracts of vegetative yeast, although not subject to the same genetic control as for generating Spo11-oligonucleotide complexes. Our findings suggest a general mechanism for repair of protein-linked DSBs.},

Among organisms in which recombination initiates prior to synapsis, recombination preferentially occurs in short 1-to 2-kb regions, known as recombination hotspots. Among mammals, genotyping sperm DNA has provided a means of monitoring recombination events at specific hotspots in male meiosis. To complement these current techniques, we developed an assay for amplifying all copies of a hotspot from the DNA of male and female germ cells, cloning the products into Escherichia coli, and SNP genotyping the resulting colonies using fluorescence technology. This approach examines the molecular details of crossover and noncrossover events of individual meioses directly at active hotspots while retaining the simplicity of using pooled DNA. Using this technique, we analyzed recombination events at the Hlx1 hotspot located on mouse chromosome 1, finding that the results agree well with a prior genetic characterization of 3026 male and 3002 female meioses.},

We have studied the way in which circular and linear molecules recombine with homologous chromosomal sequences. We show that DNA ends are highly recombinogenic and interact directly with homologous sequences. Circular hybrid plasmids can integrate by a single reciprocal crossover, but only at a low frequency. Restriction enzyme digestion within a region homologous to yeast chromosomal DNA greatly enhances the efficiency of integration. Furthermore, if two restriction cuts are made within the same homologous sequence, thereby removing an internal segment of DNA, the resulting deleted-linear molecules are still able to transform at a high frequency. Surprisingly, the integration of these gapped-linear molecules results in replacement of the missing segment using chromosomal information. The final structure is identical to that obtained from integration of a circular molecule. The integration of linear and gapped-linear molecules, but not of circular molecules, is blocked by the rad52-1 mutation. Consideration of models for plasmid integration and gene conversion suggests that RAD52 may be involved in the DNA repair synthesis required for these processes. Implications of this work for the isolation of integrative transformants, fine-structure mapping, and the cloning of mutations are discussed.},

  abstract = {In previous experiments, we have used yeast transformation to study the recombinogenic repair of double-strand breaks and gaps. A plasmid containing a double-strand gap within sequences homologous to the yeast genome integrates efficiently by crossing-over. During the process of integration, the double-strand gap is repaired, using chromosomal information as a template. This repair reaction results in the transfer of genetic information from one DNA duplex to another and is therefore a pathway for gene conversion. Because meiotic gene conversion is associated with a high frequency (up to 50\%) of crossing-over, we wished to determine the degree of association of double-strand gap repair with crossing-over. Only the class of repair events resulting in crossovers (plasmid integration) were detected in our earlier experiments with nonreplicating plasmids. In this paper, we describe the outcome of double-strand gap repair in plasmids that are capable of autonomous replication and therefore allow recovery of both crossover and noncrossover products. After the correct repair of a double-strand gap, we recover approximately equal numbers of integrated and nonintegrated plasmids. Thus, gene conversion by double-strand gap repair can occur either with or without crossing-over, and it is similar in this respect to meiotic gene conversion. Circularization of linear plasmid DNA by ligation is also observed, suggesting that yeast has an additional repair pathway for double-strand breaks that is independent of recombination. Gap repair on replicating plasmids permits rapid cloning of chromosomal alleles.},

However, purified Mus81-Eme1 prefers to cleave junctions that mimic those formed during the transition from double-strand break to dHJ. Crucially, these junctions are cleaved by Mus81-Eme1 in precisely the right orientation to guarantee the formation of a crossover every time. These data demonstrate how crossovers could arise without forming or resolving dHJs using an enzyme that is widely conserved amongst eukaryotes.},

For most organisms, including budding yeast and other fungi, mammals, nematodes, and plants, the major CO pathway depends on ZMM proteins, a set of molecular actors specifically devoted to recognize and stabilize CO-specific DNA intermediates that are formed during homologous recombination. The progressive implementation of ZMM-dependent COs takes place within the context of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a proteinaceous structure that polymerizes between homologs and participates in close homolog juxtaposition during prophase I of meiosis. While SC polymerization starts from ZMM-bound sites and ZMM proteins are required for SC polymerization in budding yeast and the fungus Sordaria, other organisms differ in their requirement for ZMM in SC elongation. This review provides an overview of ZMM functions and discusses their collaborative tasks for CO formation and SC assembly, based on recent findings and on a comparison of different model organisms.},

A putative regulator of crossing-over is RNF212, which is associated with variation in crossover rates in humans. We show that mouse RNF212 is essential for crossing-over, functioning to couple chromosome synapsis to the formation of crossover-specific recombination complexes. Selective localization of RNF212 to a subset of recombination sites is shown to be a key early step in the crossover designation process. RNF212 acts at these sites to stabilize meiosis-specific recombination factors, including the MutS{$\gamma$} complex (MSH4-MSH5). We infer that selective stabilization of key recombination proteins is a fundamental feature of meiotic crossover control. Haploinsufficiency indicates that RNF212 is a limiting factor for crossover control and raises the possibility that human alleles may alter the amount or stability of RNF212 and be risk factors for aneuploid conditions.},

Collectively referred to as gamma, these components are formed in vivo by several procedures that introduce double-stranded breaks into DNA. gamma-Components, which appeared to be the only major novel components detected by mass or 32PO4 incorporation on acetic acid-urea-Triton X-100-acetic acid-urea-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide or SDS-acetic acid-urea-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide gels after exposure of cells to ionizing radiation, are shown to be histone H2AX species that have been phosphorylated specifically at serine 139. gamma-H2AX appears rapidly after exposure of cell cultures to ionizing radiation; half-maximal amounts are reached by 1 min and maximal amounts by 10 min. At the maximum, approximately 1\% of the H2AX becomes gamma-phosphorylated per gray of ionizing radiation, a finding that indicates that 35 DNA double-stranded breaks, the number introduced by each gray into the 6 x 10(9) base pairs of a mammalian G1 genome, leads to the gamma-phosphorylation of H2AX distributed over 1\% of the chromatin. Thus, about 0.03\% of the chromatin appears to be involved per DNA double-stranded break. This value, which corresponds to about 2 x 10(6) base pairs of DNA per double-stranded break, indicates that large amounts of chromatin are involved with each DNA double-stranded break. Thus, gamma-H2AX formation is a rapid and sensitive cellular response to the presence of DNA double-stranded breaks, a response that may provide insight into higher order chromatin structures.},

Spermatocytes arrest prior to pachytene with little or no synapsis and undergo apoptosis. We did not detect Rad51/Dmc1 foci in meiotic chromosome spreads, indicating DSBs are not formed. Cisplatin-induced DSBs restored Rad51/Dmc1 foci and promoted synapsis. Spo11 localizes to discrete foci during leptotene and to homologously synapsed chromosomes. Other mouse mutants that arrest during meiotic prophase (Atm -/-, Dmc1 -/-, mei1, and Morc(-/-)) showed altered Spo11 protein localization and expression.

  abstract = {During meiotic prophase in male mammals, the heterologous X and Y chromosomes remain largely unsynapsed, and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) leads to formation of the transcriptionally silenced XY body. In birds, the heterogametic sex is female, carrying Z and W chromosomes (ZW), whereas males have the homogametic ZZ constitution. During chicken oogenesis, the heterologous ZW pair reaches a state of complete heterologous synapsis, and this might enable maintenance of transcription of Z- and W chromosomal genes during meiotic prophase. Herein, we show that the ZW pair is transiently silenced, from early pachytene to early diplotene using immunocytochemistry and gene expression analyses. We propose that ZW inactivation is most likely achieved via spreading of heterochromatin from the W on the Z chromosome. Also, persistent meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) may contribute to silencing of Z. Surprisingly, gammaH2AX, a marker of DSBs, and also the earliest histone modification that is associated with XY body formation in mammalian and marsupial spermatocytes, does not cover the ZW during the synapsed stage. However, when the ZW pair starts to desynapse, a second wave of gammaH2AX accumulates on the unsynapsed regions of Z, which also show a reappearance of the DSB repair protein RAD51. This indicates that repair of meiotic DSBs on the heterologous part of Z is postponed until late pachytene/diplotene, possibly to avoid recombination with regions on the heterologously synapsed W chromosome. Two days after entering diplotene, the Z looses gammaH2AX and shows reactivation. This is the first report of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation in a species with female heterogamety, providing evidence that this mechanism is not specific to spermatogenesis. It also indicates the presence of an evolutionary force that drives meiotic sex chromosome inactivation independent of the final achievement of synapsis.},

In this work, we used in vitro binding studies and characterized with electrophoretic mobility shift assays, mass spectrometry, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy the stoichiometry of the PRDM9 multimer of two different murine PRDM9 alleles carrying different tags and domains produced with different expression systems. Based on the migration distance of the PRDM9\textendash{}DNA complex, we show that PRDM9 forms a trimer. Moreover, this stoichiometry is adapted already by the free, soluble protein with little exchange between protein monomers. The variable ZnF array of PRDM9 is sufficient for multimerization, and at least five ZnFs form already a functional trimer. Finally, we also show that only one ZnF array within the PRDM9 oligomer binds to the DNA, whereas the remaining two ZnF arrays likely maintain the trimer by ZnF\textendash{}ZnF interactions.},

Because in many of these carriers spermatogenesis is deeply disturbed at the spermatocyte level, the association of autosomal chromatin with the XY body may impair the spermatocyte life.
METHODS: Testicular biopsies from three men carriers of three different chromosomal rearrangements have been analysed by electron microscopy (EM) and immunolocalization of meiotic proteins.
RESULTS: There is an ordered transition from isolated multivalents at early pachytene to XY body association in late pachytene, as shown in a carrier of a rob t(13;14) translocation by EM and in a reciprocal translocation t(9;14) carrier by immunofluorescence. The non-synapsed ends of the quadrivalent show BRCA1 located on the axes and the variant histone gamma-H2AX located on the chromatin. The area covered by gamma-H2AX increases with the association of the asynaptic ends with the XY body in the t(9;14) carrier, and the area covered with gamma-H2AX in the t(Y;15) carrier is larger than that of the XY body of controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The affinity between the inactive XY body and asynaptic regions of multivalents is given a material basis, and transcriptional inactivation is probably shared by these two chromatin types.},

  abstract = {Meiosis is unique to germ cells and essential for reproduction. During the first meiotic division, homologous chromosomes pair, recombine, and form chiasmata. The homologues connect via axial elements and numerous transverse filaments to form the synaptonemal complex. The synaptonemal complex is a critical component for chromosome pairing, segregation, and recombination. We previously identified a novel germ cell-specific HORMA domain encoding gene, Hormad1, a member of the synaptonemal complex and a mammalian counterpart to the yeast meiotic HORMA domain protein Hop1. Hormad1 is essential for mammalian gametogenesis as knockout male and female mice are infertile. Hormad1 deficient (Hormad1(-/) (-)) testes exhibit meiotic arrest in the early pachytene stage, and synaptonemal complexes cannot be visualized by electron microscopy. Hormad1 deficiency does not affect localization of other synaptonemal complex proteins, SYCP2 and SYCP3, but disrupts homologous chromosome pairing. Double stranded break formation and early recombination events are disrupted in Hormad1(-/) (-) testes and ovaries as shown by the drastic decrease in the {$\gamma$}H2AX, DMC1, RAD51, and RPA foci. HORMAD1 co-localizes with {$\gamma$}H2AX to the sex body during pachytene. BRCA1, ATR, and {$\gamma$}H2AX co-localize to the sex body and participate in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation and transcriptional silencing. Hormad1 deficiency abolishes {$\gamma$}H2AX, ATR, and BRCA1 localization to the sex chromosomes and causes transcriptional de-repression on the X chromosome. Unlike testes, Hormad1(-/) (-) ovaries have seemingly normal ovarian folliculogenesis after puberty. However, embryos generated from Hormad1(-/) (-) oocytes are hyper- and hypodiploid at the 2 cell and 8 cell stage, and they arrest at the blastocyst stage. HORMAD1 is therefore a critical component of the synaptonemal complex that affects synapsis, recombination, and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation and transcriptional silencing.},

  abstract = {Background
Homologous recombination is the key process that generates genetic diversity and drives evolution. SPO11 protein triggers recombination by introducing DNA double stranded breaks at discreet areas of the genome called recombination hotspots. The hotspot locations are largely determined by the DNA binding specificity of the PRDM9 protein in human, mice and most other mammals. In budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae, which lacks a Prdm9 gene, meiotic breaks are formed opportunistically in the regions of accessible chromatin, primarily at gene promoters. The genome-wide distribution of hotspots in this organism can be altered by tethering Spo11 protein to Gal4 recognition sequences in the strain expressing Spo11 attached to the DNA binding domain of the Gal4 transcription factor. To establish whether similar re-targeting of meiotic breaks can be achieved in PRDM9-containing organisms we have generated a Gal4BD-Spo11 mouse that expresses SPO11 protein joined to the DNA binding domain of yeast Gal4.

Results
We have mapped the genome-wide distribution of the recombination initiation sites in the Gal4BD-Spo11 mice. More than two hundred of the hotspots in these mice were novel and were likely defined by Gal4BD, as the Gal4 consensus motif was clustered around the centers in these hotspots. Surprisingly, meiotic DNA breaks in the Gal4BD-Spo11 mice were significantly depleted near the ends of chromosomes. The effect is particularly striking at the pseudoautosomal region of the X and Y chromosomes \textendash{} normally the hottest region in the genome.

Conclusions
Our data suggest that specific, yet-unidentified factors influence the initiation of meiotic recombination at subtelomeric chromosomal regions.},

  abstract = {DNA end-joining is the major repair pathway for double-strand breaks (DSBs) in higher eukaryotes. To understand how DSB structure affects the end-joining process in human cells, we have examined the in vivo repair of linearized plasmids containing complementary as well as several different configurations of non-complementary DNA ends. Our results demonstrate that, while complementary and blunt termini display comparable levels of error-free rejoining, end-joining fidelity is decreased to varying extents among mismatched non-complementary ends. End structure also influences the kinetics of repair, accurately recircularized substrates for blunt and complementary termini being detected significantly earlier than for mismatched non-complementary ends. These results suggest that the end-joining process is composed of an early component, capable of efficiently repairing substrates requiring a single ligation event, and a late component, involved in the rejoining of complex substrates requiring multiple processing steps. Finally, these two types of repair events may have different genetic requirements as suggested by the finding that exposure of cells to wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-related kinases (PI 3-related kinases), blocks the repair of complex substrates while having little or no effect on those requiring a simple ligation event.},

  abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are potentially lethal lesions that arise spontaneously during normal cellular metabolism, as a consequence of environmental genotoxins or radiation, or during programmed recombination processes. Repair of DSBs by homologous recombination generally occurs by gene conversion resulting from transfer of information from an intact donor duplex to both ends of the break site of the broken chromosome. In mitotic cells, gene conversion is rarely associated with reciprocal exchange and thus limits loss of heterozygosity for markers downstream of the site of repair and restricts potentially deleterious chromosome rearrangements. DSBs that arise by replication fork collapse or by erosion of uncapped telomeres have only one free end and are thought to repair by strand invasion into a homologous duplex DNA followed by replication to the chromosome end (break-induced replication, BIR). BIR from one of the two ends of a DSB would result in loss of heterozygosity, suggesting that BIR is suppressed when DSBs have two ends so that repair occurs by the more conservative gene conversion mechanism. Here we show that BIR can occur by several rounds of strand invasion, DNA synthesis and dissociation. We further show that chromosome rearrangements can occur during BIR if dissociation and reinvasion occur within dispersed repeated sequences. This dynamic process could function to promote gene conversion by capture of the displaced invading strand at two-ended DSBs to prevent BIR.},

  abstract = {Five MutS homologs (MSH), which form three heterodimeric protein complexes, have been identified in eukaryotes. While the human hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimers operate primarily in mitotic mismatch repair (MMR), the biochemical function(s) of the meiosis-specific hMSH4-hMSH5 heterodimer is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that purified hMSH4-hMSH5 binds uniquely to Holliday Junctions. Holliday Junctions stimulate the hMSH4-hMSH5 ATP hydrolysis (ATPase) activity, which is controlled by Holliday Junction-provoked ADP--{$>$}ATP exchange. ATP binding by hMSH4-hMSH5 induces the formation of a hydrolysis-independent sliding clamp that dissociates from the Holliday Junction crossover region, embracing two homologous duplex DNA arms. Fundamental differences between hMSH2-hMSH6 and hMSH4-hMSH5 Holliday Junction recognition are detailed. Our results support the attractive possibility that hMSH4-hMSH5 stabilizes and preserves a meiotic bimolecular double-strand break repair (DSBR) intermediate.},

  abstract = {Mutation in SGS1, which encodes the yeast homolog of the human Bloom helicase, or in mismatch repair (MMR) genes confers defects in the suppression of mitotic recombination between similar but nonidentical (homeologous) sequences. Mutational analysis of SGS1 suggests that the helicase activity is required for the suppression of both homologous and homeologous recombination and that the C-terminal 200 amino acids may be required specifically for the suppression of homeologous recombination. To clarify the mechanism by which the Sgs1 helicase enforces the fidelity of recombination, we examined the phenotypes associated with SGS1 deletion in MMR-defective and recombination-defective backgrounds. Deletion of SGS1 caused no additional loss of recombination fidelity above that associated with MMR defects, indicating that the suppression of homeologous recombination by Sgs1 may be dependent on MMR. However, the phenotype of the sgs1 rad51 mutant suggests a MMR-independent role of Sgs1 in the suppression of RAD51-independent recombination. While homologous recombination levels increase in sgs1{$\Delta$} and in srs2{$\Delta$} strains, the suppression of homeologous recombination was not relaxed in the srs2 mutant. Thus, although both Sgs1 and Srs2 limit the overall level of mitotic recombination, there are distinct differences in the roles of these helicases with respect to enforcement of recombination fidelity.},

  abstract = {The Spo11 protein is a eukaryotic homologue of the archaeal DNA topoisomerase VIA subunit (topo VIA). In archaea it is involved, together with its B subunit (topo VIB), in DNA replication. However, most eukaryotes, including yeasts, insects and vertebrates, instead have a single gene for Spo11/topo VIA and no homologues for topo VIB. In these organisms, Spo11 mediates DNA double-strand breaks that initiate meiotic recombination. Many plant species, in contrast to other eukaryotes, have three homologues for Spo11/topo VIA and one for topo VIB. The homologues in Arabidopsis, AtSPO11-1, AtSPO11-2 and AtSPO11-3, all share 20-30\% sequence similarity with other Spo11/topo VIA proteins, but their functional relationship during meiosis or other processes is not well understood. Previous genetic evidence suggests that AtSPO11-1 is a true orthologue of Spo11 in other eukaryotes and is required for meiotic recombination, whereas AtSPO11-3 is involved in DNA endo-reduplication as a part of the topo VI complex. In this study, we show that plants homozygous for atspo11-2 exhibit a severe sterility phenotype. Both male and female meiosis are severely disrupted in the atspo11-2 mutant, and this is associated with severe defects in synapsis during the first meiotic division and reduced meiotic recombination. Further genetic analysis revealed that AtSPO11-1 and AtSPO11-2 genetically interact, i.e. plants heterozygous for both atspo11-1 and atspo11-2 are also sterile, suggesting that AtSPO11-1 and AtSPO11-2 have largely overlapping functions. Thus, the three Arabidopsis Spo11 homologues appear to function in two discrete processes, i.e. AtSPO11-1 and AtSPO11-2 in meiotic recombination and AtSPO11-3 in DNA replication.},

We find that M26 stimulates the formation of meiosis-specific double-strand DNA breaks at multiple sites surrounding M26. Like hot spot activity, breakage requires the M26 heptamer, Pcr1, and the general recombination factor Rec12. When the M26 heptamer is moved to new positions within ade6, new break sites are observed spanning approximately 0.5-2 kb around the moved heptamer. Break frequency is strongly correlated with recombination frequency for these alleles. The occurrence of breaks at M26 suggests mechanistic similarities to hot spots in the distantly related yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

DNA helicases, such as Bloom's syndrome protein (BLM), regulate HR at several levels, in attenuating unwanted HR events and in determining the outcome of HR.

MMR proteins also act during genetic recombination in steps that include repairing mismatches in heteroduplex DNA, modulating meiotic crossover control, removing 3' non-homologous tails during double-strand break repair, and preventing recombination between divergent sequences. In this review we will, first, discuss roles for MMR proteins in repairing mismatches that occur during recombination, particularly during meiosis. We will also explore how studying this process has helped to refine models of double-strand break repair, and particularly to our understanding of gene conversion gradients. Second, we will examine the role of MMR proteins in repressing homeologous recombination, i.e. recombination between divergent sequences. We will also compare the requirements for MMR proteins in preventing homeologous recombination to the requirements for these proteins in mismatch repair.},

  abstract = {Sexual reproduction depends on the success of faithful chromosome transmission during meiosis to yield viable gametes. Central to meiosis is the process of recombination between paternal and maternal chromosomes, which boosts the genetic diversity of progeny and ensures normal homologous chromosome segregation. Imperfections in meiotic recombination are the source of de novo germline mutations, abnormal gametes, and infertility. Thus, not surprisingly, cells have developed a variety of mechanisms and tight controls to ensure sufficient and well-distributed recombination events within their genomes, the details of which remain to be fully elucidated. Local and genome-wide studies of normal and genetically engineered cells have uncovered a remarkable stochasticity in the number and positioning of recombination events per chromosome and per cell, which reveals an impressive level of flexibility. In this minireview, we summarize our contemporary understanding of meiotic recombination and its control mechanisms, and address the seemingly paradoxical and poorly understood diversity of recombination sites. Flexibility in the distribution of meiotic recombination events within genomes may reside in regulation at the chromatin level, with histone modifications playing a recently recognized role.},

We review the genetic properties of meiotic recombination and previous models of conversion and crossing-over. In these models, recombination is initiated by single-strand nicks, and heteroduplex DNA is generated. Gene conversion is explained by the repair of mismatches present in heteroduplex DNA. We propose a new mechanism for meiotic recombination, in which events are initiated by double-strand breaks that are enlarged to double-strand gaps. Gene conversion can then occur by the repair of a double-strand gap, and postmeiotic segregation can result from heteroduplex DNA formed at the boundaries of the gap-repair region. The repair of double-strand gaps is an efficient process in yeast, and is known to be associated with crossing-over. The genetic implications of the double-strand-break repair model are explored.},

Ski8p is cytoplasmically localized in all vegetative and sexual cycle cells, and is nuclear localized, specifically in early-mid-meiotic prophase, in temporal correlation with Spo11p, the meiotic double-strand break (DSB) transesterase. Localizations of Ski8p and Spo11p are mutually interdependent. ski8 mutants exhibit defects in vegetative growth, entry into the sexual program, and sporulation. Diverse meiotic defects, also seen in spo11 mutants, are diagnostic of DSB absence, and they are restored by exogenous DSBs. These results suggest that Ski8p promotes meiotic DSB formation by acting directly within meiotic prophase chromosomes. Mutant phenotypes also divide meiotic homolog juxtaposition into three successive, mechanistically distinct steps; recognition, presynaptic alignment, and synapsis, which are distinguished by their differential dependence on DSBs.},

BRCA2 protein regulates recombinational repair by interaction with RAD51 via a series of degenerate BRC repeat motifs encoded by exon 11 (BRCA2996\textendash{}2113), and an unrelated C-terminal domain (BRCA23265\textendash{}3330). BRCA2 is also required for meiotic recombination. Here, we show that human BRCA2 binds the meiosis-specific recombinase DMC1 and define the primary DMC1 interaction site to a 26 amino-acid region (BRCA22386\textendash{}2411). This region is highly conserved in BRCA2 proteins from a variety of mammalian species, but is absent in BRCA2 from Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, and other eukaryotes. We demonstrate the critical importance of Phe2406, Pro2408, and Pro2409 at the conserved motif 2404KVFVPPFK2411. This interaction domain, defined as the PhePP motif, promotes specific interactions between BRCA2 and DMC1, but not with RAD51. Thus, the RAD51 and DMC1 interaction domains on BRCA2 are distinct from each other, allowing coordinated interactions of the two recombinases with BRCA2 at meiosis. These results lead us to suggest that BRCA2 is a universal regulator of RAD51/DMC1 recombinase actions.},

Analysis of Exo1(-/-) cells for mismatch repair activity in vitro showed that Exo1 is required for the repair of base:base and single-base insertion/deletion mismatches in both 5' and 3' nick-directed repair. The repair defect in Exo1(-/-) cells also caused elevated microsatellite instability at a mononucleotide repeat marker and a significant increase in mutation rate at the Hprt locus. Exo1(-/-) animals displayed reduced survival and increased susceptibility to the development of lymphomas. In addition, Exo1(-/-) male and female mice were sterile because of a meiotic defect. Meiosis in Exo1(-/-) animals proceeded through prophase I; however, the chromosomes exhibited dynamic loss of chiasmata during metaphase I, resulting in meiotic failure and apoptosis.

  abstract = {Mutations in BLM, which encodes a RecQ helicase, give rise to Bloom's syndrome, a disorder associated with cancer predisposition and genomic instability. A defining feature of Bloom's syndrome is an elevated frequency of sister chromatid exchanges. These arise from crossing over of chromatid arms during homologous recombination, a ubiquitous process that exists to repair DNA double-stranded breaks and damaged replication forks. Whereas crossing over is required in meiosis, in mitotic cells it can be associated with detrimental loss of heterozygosity. BLM forms an evolutionarily conserved complex with human topoisomerase IIIalpha (hTOPO IIIalpha), which can break and rejoin DNA to alter its topology. Inactivation of homologues of either protein leads to hyper-recombination in unicellular organisms. Here, we show that BLM and hTOPO IIIalpha together effect the resolution of a recombination intermediate containing a double Holliday junction. The mechanism, which we term double-junction dissolution, is distinct from classical Holliday junction resolution and prevents exchange of flanking sequences. Loss of such an activity explains many of the cellular phenotypes of Bloom's syndrome. These results have wider implications for our understanding of the process of homologous recombination and the mechanisms that exist to prevent tumorigenesis.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is initiated by Spo11-generated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) . A fraction of total DSBs is processed into crossovers (CRs) between homologous chromosomes, which promote their accurate segregation at meiosis I (MI) . The coordination of recombination-associated events and MI progression is governed by the "pachytene checkpoint", which in budding yeast requires Rad17, a component of a PCNA clamp-like complex, and Pch2, a putative AAA-ATPase . We show that two genetically separable pathways monitor the presence of distinct meiotic recombination-associated lesions: First, delayed MI progression in the presence of DNA repair intermediates is suppressed when RAD17 or SAE2, encoding a DSB-end processing factor , is deleted. Second, delayed MI progression in the presence of aberrant synaptonemal complex (SC) is suppressed when PCH2 is deleted. Importantly, ZIP1, encoding the central element of the SC , is required for PCH2-dependent checkpoint activation. Analysis of the rad17Deltapch2Delta double mutant revealed a redundant function regulating interhomolog CR formation. These findings suggest a link between the surveillance of distinct recombination-associated lesions, control of CR formation kinetics, and regulation of MI timing. A PCH2-ZIP1-dependent checkpoint in meiosis is likely conserved among synaptic organisms from yeast to human .},

  abstract = {Four-way DNA intermediates, called Holliday junctions (HJs), can form during meiotic and mitotic recombination, and their removal is crucial for chromosome segregation. A group of ubiquitous and highly specialized structure-selective endonucleases catalyze the cleavage of HJs into two disconnected DNA duplexes in a reaction called HJ resolution. These enzymes, called HJ resolvases, have been identified in bacteria and their bacteriophages, archaea, and eukaryotes. In this review, we discuss fundamental aspects of the HJ structure and their interaction with junction-resolving enzymes. This is followed by a brief discussion of the eubacterial RuvABC enzymes, which provide the paradigm for HJ resolvases in other organisms. Finally, we review the biochemical and structural properties of some well-characterized resolvases from archaea, bacteriophage, and eukaryotes., Four-way DNA intermediates (Holliday junctions) form during homologous recombination. Specialized structure-selective endonucleases called resolvases, which are present in all domains of life, catalyze their cleavage.},

  abstract = {The mouse Dmc1 gene is an E. coli RecA homolog that is specifically expressed in meiosis. The DMC1 protein was detected in leptotene-to-zygotene spermatocytes, when homolog pairing likely initiates. Targeted gene disruption in the male mouse showed an arrest of meiosis of germ cells at the early zygotene stage, followed by apoptosis. In female mice lacking the Dmc1 gene, normal differentiation of oogenesis was aborted in embryos, and germ cells disappeared in the adult ovary. Meiotic chromosome analysis of Dmc1-deficient mouse spermatocytes revealed random spread of univalent axial elements without correct pairing between homologs. In rare cases, however, we observed complex pairing among nonhomologs. Thus, the mouse Dmc1 gene is required for homologous synapsis of chromosomes in meiosis.},

  abstract = {Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a rare autosomal recessive human disease whose clinical features include growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and increased susceptibility to lymphoid malignancies. Cells from NBS patients exhibit gamma-irradiation sensitivity, S-phase checkpoint defects, and genomic instability. Recently, it was demonstrated that this chromosomal breakage syndrome is caused by mutations in the NBS1 gene that result in a total loss of full-length NBS1 expression. Here we report that in contrast to the viability of NBS patients, targeted inactivation of NBS1 in mice leads to early embryonic lethality in utero and is associated with poorly developed embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Mutant blastocysts showed greatly diminished expansion of the inner cell mass in culture, and this finding suggests that NBS1 mediates essential functions during proliferation in the absence of externally induced damage. Together, our results indicate that the complex phenotypes observed in NBS patients and cell lines may not result from a complete inactivation of NBS1 but may instead result from hypomorphic truncation mutations compatible with cell viability.},
