  abstract = {The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility protein BRCA1 is evolutionarily conserved and functions in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair through homologous recombination, but its role in meiosis is poorly understood. By using genetic analysis, we investigated the role of the Caenorhabditis elegans BRCA1 orthologue (brc-1) during meiotic prophase. The null mutant in the brc-1 gene is viable, fertile and shows the wild-type complement of six bivalents in most diakinetic nuclei, which is indicative of successful crossover recombination. However, brc-1 mutants show an abnormal increase in apoptosis and RAD-51 foci at pachytene that are abolished by loss of spo-11 function, suggesting a defect in meiosis rather than during premeiotic DNA replication. In genetic backgrounds in which chiasma formation is abrogated, such as him-14/MSH4 and syp-2, loss of brc-1 leads to chromosome fragmentation suggesting that brc-1 is dispensable for crossing over but essential for DSB repair through inter-sister recombination.},

PRDM9 has been identified as the gene responsible for specifying the location of recombination hotspots during meiosis and is also the only known vertebrate gene associated with reproductive isolation between species. PRDM9 encodes a protein with a highly variable zinc finger (ZF) domain that varies between as well as within species. In the present study, the ZF domain of PRDM9 on chromosome 1 was characterized for the first time in 15 goat breeds and 25 sheep breeds of India. A remarkable variation in the number and sequence of ZF domains was observed. The number of ZF repeats in the ZF array varied from eight to 12 yielding five homozygous and 10 heterozygous genotypes. The number of different ZF domains was 84 and 52 producing 36 and 26 unique alleles in goats and sheep respectively. The posterior mean of dN/dS or omega values were calculated using the codeml tool of pamlx to identify amino acids that are evolving positively in goats and sheep, as positions -1, +3 and +6 in the ZF domain have been reported to experience strong positive selection across different lineages. Our study identified sites -5, -1, +3, +4 and +6 to be experiencing positive selection. Small ruminant zinc fingers were also found to be evolving under concerted evolution. Our results demonstrate the existence of a vast diversity of PRDM9 in goats and sheep, which is in concert with reports in many metazoans.},

In this study, the terminal ZF domain of PRDM9 on bovine chromosome 1 and its paralog on chromosome 22 were characterized in 225 samples from five ruminant species (cattle, yak, mithun, sheep and goat). We found extraordinary variation in the number of PRDM9 zinc fingers (6 to 12). We sequenced PRDM9 ZF encoding region from 15 individuals (carrying the same ZF number in both copies) and found 43 different ZF domain sequences. Ruminant zinc fingers of PRDM9 were found to be diversifying under positive selection and concerted evolution, specifically at positions involved in defining their DNA-binding specificity, consistent with the reports from other vertebrates such as mice, humans, equids and chimpanzees. ZF-encoding regions of the PRDM7, a paralog of PRDM9 on bovine chromosome 22 and on unknown chromosomes in other studied species were found to contain 84 base repeat units as in PRDM9, but there were multiple disruptive mutations after the first repeat unit. The diversity of the ZFs suggests that PRDM9 may activate recombination hotspots that are largely unique to each ruminant species.},

  abstract = {Hybrid sterility or reproductive isolation in mammals has been attributed to allelic incompatibilities in a DNA-binding protein PRDM9. Not only is PRDM9 exceptional in being the only known 'speciation gene' in vertebrates, but it is also considered to be the fastest evolving gene in the genome. The terminal zinc finger (ZF) domain of PRDM9 specifies genome-wide meiotic recombination hotspot locations in mammals. Intriguingly, PRDM9 ZF domain is highly variable between as well as within species, possibly activating different recombination hotspots. The present study characterized the full-length coding sequence of PRDM9 in cattle and buffalo and explored the diversity of the ZF array in 514 samples from different bovids (cattle, yak, mithun, and buffalo). Substantial numerical and sequence variability were observed in the ZFs, with the number of repeats ranging from 6 to 9 in different bovines. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of 37 different ZFs in cattle, 3 in mithun, 4 in yak, and 13 in buffaloes producing 41 unique PRDM9 alleles in these species. The posterior mean of dN/dS or omega values calculated using Codeml tool of PAMLX identified sites -5, -1, +2, +3, +4, +5, and +6 in the ZF domain to be evolving positively in the studied species. Concerted evolution which typifies the evolution of this gene was consistently evident in all bovines. Our results demonstrate the extraordinary diversity of PRDM9 ZF array across bovines, reinforcing similar observations in other metazoans. The high variability is suggestive of unique repertoire of meiotic recombination hotspots in each species.},

To explore factors that affect binding and subsequent recombination outcomes, we mapped human PRDM9 binding sites in a transfected human cell line and measured PRDM9-induced histone modifications. These data reveal varied DNA-binding modalities of PRDM9. We also find that human PRDM9 frequently binds promoters, despite their low recombination rates, and it can activate expression of a small number of genes including CTCFL and VCX. Furthermore, we identify specific sequence motifs that predict consistent, localized meiotic recombination suppression around a subset of PRDM9 binding sites. These motifs strongly associate with KRAB-ZNF protein binding, TRIM28 recruitment, and specific histone modifications. Finally, we demonstrate that, in addition to binding DNA, PRDM9's zinc fingers also mediate its multimerization, and we show that a pair of highly diverged alleles preferentially form homo-multimers.},

This success has led to this model being invoked to explain double-strand break (DSB) repair in other contexts. However, most non-crossover recombinants generated during S. cerevisiae meiosis do not arise via a DSBR pathway. Furthermore, and it is becoming increasing clear that DSBR is a minor pathway for recombinational repair of DSBs that occur in mitotically proliferating cells; rather, the synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) model appears to describe mitotic DSB repair more accurately. Fundamental dissimilarities between meiotic and mitotic recombination are not unexpected, since meiotic recombination serves a very different purpose (accurate chromosome segregation, which requires crossovers) than mitotic recombination (repair of DNA damage, which typically generates non-crossovers).},

MLH1 is a mismatch repair protein necessary for meiotic recombination in mice, and MLH1 foci have been proposed to mark crossover sites. We present evidence that the number and distribution of MLH1 foci on SCs closely correspond to the number and distribution of chiasmata on diplotene-metaphase I chromosomes. MLH1 foci were typically excluded from SC in centromeric heterochromatin. For SCs with one MLH1 focus, most foci were located near the middle of long SCs, but near the distal end of short SCs. For SCs with two MLH1 foci, the distribution of foci was bimodal regardless of SC length, with most foci located near the proximal and distal ends. The distribution of MLH1 foci indicated interference between foci. We observed a consistent relative distance (percent of SC length in euchromatin) between two foci on SCs of different lengths, suggesting that positive interference between MLH1 foci is a function of relative SC length. The extended length of pachytene SCs, as compared to more condensed diplotene-metaphase I bivalents, makes mapping crossover events and interference distances using MLH1 foci more accurate than using chiasmata.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination involves the repair of double-strand break (DSB) precursors as crossovers (COs) or noncrossovers (NCOs). The proper number and distribution of COs is critical for successful chromosome segregation and formation of viable gametes. In budding yeast the majority of COs occurs through a pathway dependent on the ZMM proteins (Zip2-Zip3-Zip4-Spo16, Msh4-Msh5, Mer3), which form foci at CO-committed sites. Here we show that the DNA-damage-response kinase Tel1/ATM limits ZMM-independent recombination. By whole-genome mapping of recombination products, we find that lack of Tel1 results in higher recombination and reduced CO interference. Yet the number of Zip3 foci in tel1{$\Delta$} cells is similar to wild type, and these foci show normal interference. Analysis of recombination in a tel1{$\Delta$} zip3{$\Delta$} double mutant indicates that COs are less dependent on Zip3 in the absence of Tel1. Together these results reveal that in the absence of Tel1, a significant proportion of COs occurs through a non-ZMM-dependent pathway, contributing to a CO landscape with poor interference. We also see a significant change in the distribution of all detectable recombination products in the absence of Tel1, Sgs1, Zip3, or Msh4, providing evidence for altered DSB distribution. These results support the previous finding that DSB interference depends on Tel1, and further suggest an additional level of DSB interference created through local repression of DSBs around CO-designated sites.},

However, evidence for a local mutagenic effect of recombination from population sequence data has been equivocal, likely because mutation is only one of several forces shaping sequence variation. By sequencing large numbers of single crossover molecules obtained from human sperm for two recombination hotspots, we find direct evidence that recombination is mutagenic: Crossovers carry more de novo mutations than nonrecombinant DNA molecules analyzed for the same donors and hotspots. The observed mutations were primarily CG to TA transitions, with a higher frequency of transitions at CpG than non-CpGs sites. This enrichment of mutations at CpG sites at hotspots could predominate in methylated regions involving frequent single-stranded DNA processing as part of DSB repair. In addition, our data set provides evidence that GC alleles are preferentially transmitted during crossing over, opposing mutation, and shows that GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) predominates over mutation in the sequence evolution of hotspots. These findings are consistent with the idea that gBGC could be an adaptation to counteract the mutational load of recombination.},

Recombination is an important process in generating diversity and producing selectively advantageous genetic combinations. Thus, changes in recombination hotspots may influence speciation. To investigate the variation in recombination processes in humans and their closest existing relatives, Auton et al. (p. 193, published online 15 March) prepared a fine-scale genetic map of the Western chimpanzee and compared it with that of humans. While rates of recombination are comparable between humans and chimpanzees, the locations and genetic motifs associated with recombination differ between the species.
To study the evolution of recombination rates in apes, we developed methodology to construct a fine-scale genetic map from high-throughput sequence data from 10 Western chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus. Compared to the human genetic map, broad-scale recombination rates tend to be conserved, but with exceptions, particularly in regions of chromosomal rearrangements and around the site of ancestral fusion in human chromosome 2. At fine scales, chimpanzee recombination is dominated by hotspots, which show no overlap with those of humans even though rates are similarly elevated around CpG islands and decreased within genes. The hotspot-specifying protein PRDM9 shows extensive variation among Western chimpanzees, and there is little evidence that any sequence motifs are enriched in hotspots. The contrasting locations of hotspots provide a natural experiment, which demonstrates the impact of recombination on base composition.
Chimpanzees show similar genetic recombination rates as humans but differ in the genomic regions involved.

However, uniquely amongst mammals, canids appear to lack a functional version of PRDM9 and may therefore provide a model for understanding recombination that occurs in the absence of PRDM9, and thus how PRDM9 functions to shape the recombination landscape. We have constructed a fine-scale genetic map from patterns of linkage disequilibrium assessed using high-throughput sequence data from 51 free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. While broad-scale properties of recombination appear similar to other mammalian species, our fine-scale estimates indicate that canine highly elevated recombination rates are observed in the vicinity of CpG rich regions including gene promoter regions, but show little association with H3K4 trimethylation marks identified in spermatocytes. By comparison to genomic data from the Andean fox, Lycalopex culpaeus, we show that biased gene conversion is a plausible mechanism by which the high CpG content of the dog genome could have occurred.},

In humans, a zinc-finger protein, PRDM9, is believed to initiate recombination in {$>$}40\% of hotspots by binding to a specific DNA sequence motif. However, the PRDM9 coding sequence is disrupted in the dog genome assembly, raising questions regarding the nature and control of recombination in dogs. By analyzing the sequences of PRDM9 orthologs in a number of dog breeds and several carnivores, we show here that this gene was inactivated early in canid evolution. We next use patterns of linkage disequilibrium using more than 170,000 SNP markers typed in almost 500 dogs to estimate the recombination rates in the dog genome using a coalescent-based approach. Broad-scale recombination rates show good correspondence with an existing linkage-based map. Significant variation in recombination rate is observed on the fine scale, and we are able to detect over 4000 recombination hotspots with high confidence. In contrast to human hotspots, 40\% of canine hotspots are characterized by a distinct peak in GC content. A comparative genomic analysis indicates that these peaks are present also as weaker peaks in the panda, suggesting that the hotspots have been continually reinforced by accelerated and strongly GC biased nucleotide substitutions, consistent with the long-term action of biased gene conversion on the dog lineage. These results are consistent with the loss of PRDM9 in canids, resulting in a greater evolutionary stability of recombination hotspots. The genetic determinants of recombination hotspots in the dog genome may thus reflect a fundamental process of relevance to diverse animal species.},

  abstract = {By taking advantage of a recently developed reference marker set for avian genome analysis we have constructed a gene-based genetic map of the collared flycatcher, an important ``ecological model'' for studies of life-history evolution, sexual selection, speciation, and quantitative genetics. A pedigree of 322 birds from a natural population was genotyped for 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 170 protein-coding genes and 71 microsatellites. Altogether, 147 gene markers and 64 microsatellites form 33 linkage groups with a total genetic distance of 1787 cM. Male recombination rates are, on average, 22\% higher than female rates (total distance 1982 vs. 1627 cM). The ability to anchor the collared flycatcher map with the chicken genome via the gene-based SNPs revealed an extraordinary degree of both synteny and gene-order conservation during avian evolution. The great majority of chicken chromosomes correspond to a single linkage group in collared flycatchers, with only a few cases of inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements. The rate of chromosomal diversification, fissions/fusions, and inversions combined is thus considerably lower in birds (0.05/MY) than in mammals (0.6\textendash{}2.0/MY). A dearth of repeat elements, known to promote chromosomal breakage, in avian genomes may contribute to their stability. The degree of genome stability is likely to have important consequences for general evolutionary patterns and may explain, for example, the comparatively slow rate by which genetic incompatibility among lineages of birds evolves.},

  abstract = {Segregation of chromosomes during the first meiotic division relies on crossovers established during prophase. Although crossovers are strictly regulated so that at least one occurs per chromosome, individual variation in crossover levels is not uncommon. In an analysis of different inbred strains of male mice, we identified among-strain variation in the number of foci for the crossover-associated protein MLH1. We report studies of strains with "low" (CAST/EiJ), "medium" (C3H/HeJ), and "high" (C57BL/6J) genome-wide MLH1 values to define factors responsible for this variation. We utilized immunofluorescence to analyze the number and distribution of proteins that function at different stages in the recombination pathway: RAD51 and DMC1, strand invasion proteins acting shortly after double-strand break (DSB) formation, MSH4, part of the complex stabilizing double Holliday junctions, and the Bloom helicase BLM, thought to have anti-crossover activity. For each protein, we identified strain-specific differences that mirrored the results for MLH1; i.e., CAST/EiJ mice had the lowest values, C3H/HeJ mice intermediate values, and C57BL/6J mice the highest values. This indicates that differences in the numbers of DSBs (as identified by RAD51 and DMC1) are translated into differences in the number of crossovers, suggesting that variation in crossover levels is established by the time of DSB formation. However, DSBs per se are unlikely to be the primary determinant, since allelic variation for the DSB-inducing locus Spo11 resulted in differences in the numbers of DSBs but not the number of MLH1 foci. Instead, chromatin conformation appears to be a more important contributor, since analysis of synaptonemal complex length and DNA loop size also identified consistent strain-specific differences; i.e., crossover frequency increased with synaptonemal complex length and was inversely related to chromatin loop size. This indicates a relationship between recombination and chromatin compaction that may develop as DSBs form or earlier during establishment of the meiotic axis.},

  abstract = {Genetic recombination during meiosis functions to increase genetic diversity, promotes elimination of deleterious alleles, and helps assure proper segregation of chromatids. Mammalian recombination events are concentrated at specialized sites, termed hotspots, whose locations are determined by PRDM9, a zinc finger DNA-binding histone methyltransferase. Prdm9 is highly polymorphic with most alleles activating their own set of hotspots. In populations exhibiting high frequencies of heterozygosity, questions remain about the influences different alleles have in heterozygous individuals where the two variant forms of PRDM9 typically do not activate equivalent populations of hotspots. We now find that, in addition to activating its own hotspots, the presence of one Prdm9 allele can modify the activity of hotspots activated by the other allele. PRDM9 function is also dosage sensitive; Prdm9+/- heterozygous null mice have reduced numbers and less active hotspots and increased numbers of aberrant germ cells. In mice carrying two Prdm9 alleles, there is allelic competition; the stronger Prdm9 allele can partially or entirely suppress chromatin modification and recombination at hotspots of the weaker allele. In cell cultures, PRDM9 protein variants form functional heteromeric complexes which can bind hotspots sequences. When a heteromeric complex binds at a hotspot of one PRDM9 variant, the other PRDM9 variant, which would otherwise not bind, can still methylate hotspot nucleosomes. We propose that in heterozygous individuals the underlying molecular mechanism of allelic suppression results from formation of PRDM9 heteromers, where the DNA binding activity of one protein variant dominantly directs recombination initiation towards its own hotspots, effectively titrating down recombination by the other protein variant. In natural populations with many heterozygous individuals, allelic competition will influence the recombination landscape.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination generates new genetic variation and assures the proper segregation of chromosomes in gametes. PRDM9, a zinc finger protein with histone methyltransferase activity, initiates meiotic recombination by binding DNA at recombination hotspots and directing the position of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). The DSB repair mechanism suggests that hotspots should eventually self-destruct, yet genome-wide recombination levels remain constant, a conundrum known as the hotspot paradox. To test if PRDM9 drives this evolutionary erosion, we measured activity of the Prdm9
Cst allele in two Mus musculus subspecies, M.m. castaneus, in which Prdm9Cst arose, and M.m. domesticus, into which Prdm9Cst was introduced experimentally. Comparing these two strains, we find that haplotype differences at hotspots lead to qualitative and quantitative changes in PRDM9 binding and activity. Using Mus spretus as an outlier, we found most variants affecting PRDM9Cst binding arose and were fixed in M.m. castaneus, suppressing hotspot activity. Furthermore, M.m. castaneus\texttimes{}M.m. domesticus F1 hybrids exhibit novel hotspots, with large haplotype biases in both PRDM9 binding and chromatin modification. These novel hotspots represent sites of historic evolutionary erosion that become activated in hybrids due to crosstalk between one parent's Prdm9 allele and the opposite parent's chromosome. Together these data support a model where haplotype-specific PRDM9 binding directs biased gene conversion at hotspots, ultimately leading to hotspot erosion., Sexually reproducing creatures need to produce germ cells, notably sperm and egg, and do so using a specialized cell division, termed meiosis. A hallmark of meiosis is the process of recombination, in which pieces of maternal and paternal genetic material are exchanged, creating new combinations that are inherited by their progeny. Recombination increases diversity in subsequent generations, facilitating evolution. However, if recombination goes awry, it can lead to genetic disorders and spontaneous abortions in humans. In most mammals the sites of recombination are directed by the enzyme PRDM9 to specific regions on DNA, termed hotspots. For several decades it has been speculated that the process of recombination should lead to the eventual inactivation of hotspots, resulting in the loss of ability to reproduce. The discovery of PRDM9 provided a potential solution to this dilemma when the appearance of new PRDM9 alleles with altered DNA binding specificity would immediately create a new set of hotspots. We have now used the power of mouse genetics and large scale measurements of PRDM9 location and activity to show that this cycle of hotspot loss and recovery does indeed occur over the course of hundreds of thousands of years, and is directed by PRDM9.},

Here, we identify PRDM9 orthologs from genome and transcriptome data in 225 species. We find the complete PRDM9 ortholog across distantly related vertebrates but, despite this broad conservation, infer a minimum of six partial and three complete losses. Strikingly, taxa carrying the complete ortholog of PRDM9 are precisely those with rapid evolution of its predicted binding affinity, suggesting that all domains are necessary for directing recombination. Indeed, as we show, swordtail fish carrying only a partial but conserved ortholog share recombination properties with PRDM9 knock-outs., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24133.001, The genetic information of Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants and fungi) is encoded on strands of DNA called chromosomes. In animals that sexually reproduce, most cells carry two copies of each chromosome, with one inherited from each of their parents. Sex cells such as sperm and egg cells are the exception, and contain only a paternal or maternal set respectively. These chromosomes are not exact copies of the parental chromosomes, but are instead combinations of both of them, generated by a process called meiotic recombination. Meiotic recombination begins by breaking the chromosomes, and the repair of those breaks shuffles DNA segments between the two chromosomes. This shuffling is known as a ``recombination event''., In humans, apes and mice, the location of recombination events depends on where a protein called PRDM9 binds to the DNA. Over the course of evolution, this binding location has changed relatively rapidly so that even closely related species such as humans and chimpanzees localize recombination events to different DNA regions. In contrast, closely related species that do not produce PRDM9 tend to direct recombination events to similar DNA regions., It remains unclear when PRDM9 first evolved its role in recombination, or why different methods of directing recombination have developed. To begin answering these questions, Baker, Schumer et al. investigated whether 225 species of vertebrates (backboned animals) have a gene that encodes PRDM9. This analysis revealed that even distantly related animals have genes that produce equivalents of the complete PRDM9 protein. However, several species have independently lost the ability to produce PRDM9. In certain other species, particular regions of the gene have been removed or shortened. Notably, only species that carry genes that contain regions called the KRAB and SSXRD domains show relatively rapid evolution of where PRDM9 binds in the DNA., To investigate this phenomenon further, Baker, Schumer et al. constructed a map of recombination events in swordtail fish, which carry a version of the gene that lacks the KRAB and SSXRD domains. The PRDM9 protein produced by this gene does not direct where recombination events occur., Overall, it appears that the KRAB and SSXRD domains are necessary for PRDM9 to direct meiotic recombination. Furthermore, Baker, Schumer et al. predict that those species that have complete versions of PRDM9 use this protein to localize recombination events. Knowing which species use PRDM9 in this way is the first step towards understanding why recombination mechanisms change in evolution, and with what consequences., DOI:

  abstract = {Selection on one or more genes inevitably perturbs other genes, even when those genes have no direct effect on fitness. This article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking, concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate lambda, the rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 + E[1/pq]lambda/(2(2lambda + r))), where the recombination rate r is much smaller than the strength of selection. In spatially structured populations, the effects of any one substitution are weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more weakly, on the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4(pi rho sigma)2. Spatial subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur more frequently than is indicated by the overall rate of molecular evolution. However, it seems unlikely that such sweeps can be sufficiently frequent to increase significantly the drift of neutral alleles.},

  abstract = {Author SummaryIn most sexually reproducing species, during meiosis a high level of recombination between homologous chromosomes is induced. These events are not evenly distributed in the genome but clustered in small regions called hotspots. The genetic factors controlling their activity in mammals are still poorly understood. We have performed experiments to identify factors that influence the recombination activity of a hotspot in the mouse genome. By detecting the recombination products by a PCR-based method, we show that the variation of hotspot activity (up to 2,000-fold) is mainly due to differences of initiation frequencies, rather than differences at later steps of recombination. In addition, we identify several levels of controls. First, the initiation of recombination is activated by a haplotype-specific element, localized outside the hotspot and acting in trans (when heterozygous, this element allows for recombination initiation on both homologous chromosomes). This suggests a unique type of regulation requiring the presence of a diffusible factor and/or of communications between homologous chromosomes before recombination. A second element represses the recombination initiation in cis, which might indicate the influence of local polymorphisms affecting initiation events. Our results provide the first functional analysis of the control of recombination initiation sites for meiotic recombination in mammals.},

A colony of the fat-tailed insec-tivore Sminthopsis crassicaudata (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae), which was established in the R. A. Fisher Laboratories, University of Adelaide, more than 20 years ago1, has now provided unusual linkage data. These data indicate that the linkage situation in this marsupial species differs markedly from that in eutherian mammals. Extremely large differences exist between the sexes in the values of the recombination frequencies, with much closer linkage occurring in females. Cytological examination of meiosis in males and females has revealed a major difference between the sexes in chromosome behaviour.},

  abstract = {During meiosis, chromatin undergoes extensive changes to facilitate recombination, homolog pairing, and chromosome segregation. To investigate the relationship between chromatin organization and meiotic processes, we used formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to map open chromatin during the transition from mitosis to meiosis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that meiosis-induced opening of chromatin is associated with meiotic DSB hotpots. The positive association between open chromatin and DSB hotspots is most prominent 3 h into meiosis, when the early meiotic genes DMC1 and HOP1 exhibit maximum transcription and the early recombination genes SPO11 and RAD51 are strongly up-regulated. While the degree of chromatin openness is positively associated with the occurrence of recombination hotspots, many hotspots occur outside of open chromatin. Of particular interest, many DSB hotspots that fell outside of meiotic open chromatin nonetheless occurred in chromatin that had recently been open during mitotic growth. Finally, we find evidence for meiosis-specific opening of chromatin at the regions adjacent to boundaries of subtelomeric sequences, which exhibit specific crossover control patterns hypothesized to be regulated by chromatin.},

The protein contains a zinc finger array that in humans can recognise a short sequence motif associated with hot spots, with binding to this motif possibly triggering hot-spot activity via chromatin remodelling. We now show that variation in the zinc finger array in humans has a profound effect on sperm hot-spot activity, even at hot spots lacking the sequence motif. Very subtle changes within the array can create hot-spot non-activating and enhancing alleles, and even trigger the appearance of a new hot spot. PRDM9 thus appears to be the preeminent global regulator of hot spots in humans. Variation at this locus also influences aspects of genome instability, specifically a megabase-scale rearrangement underlying two genomic disorders as well as minisatellite instability, implicating PRDM9 as a risk factor for some pathological genome rearrangements.},

However, our view of PRDM9 regulation, in terms of motifs defined and hotspots studied, has a strong bias toward the PRDM9 A variant particularly common in Europeans. We show that population diversity can reveal a second class of hotspots specifically activated by PRDM9 variants common in Africans but rare in Europeans. These African-enhanced hotspots nevertheless share very similar properties with their counterparts activated by the A variant. The specificity of hotspot activation is such that individuals with differing PRDM9 genotypes, even within the same population, can use substantially if not completely different sets of hotspots. Each African-enhanced hotspot is activated by a distinct spectrum of PRDM9 variants, despite the fact that all are predicted to bind the same sequence motif. This differential activation points to complex interactions between the zinc-finger array and hotspots and identifies features of the array that might be important in controlling hotspot activity.},

The exceptionally high recombination rate is distributed genome-wide, but varies by two orders of magnitude. Analysis of chromosome, sequence, and gene parameters with respect to recombination showed that local recombination rate is associated with distance to the telomere, GC content, and the number of simple repeats as described for low-recombining genomes. Recombination rate does not decrease with chromosome size. On average 5.7 recombination events per chromosome pair per meiosis are found in the honey bee genome. This contrasts with a wide range of taxa that have a uniform recombination frequency of about 1.6 per chromosome pair. The excess of recombination activity does not support a mechanistic role of recombination in stabilizing pairs of homologous chromosome during chromosome pairing. Recombination rate is associated with gene size, suggesting that introns are larger in regions of low recombination and may improve the efficacy of selection in these regions. Very few transposons and no retrotransposons are present in the high-recombining genome. We propose evolutionary explanations for the exceptionally high genome-wide recombination rate.},

Here we show that, although a substantial fraction of the genome shows some degree of sexually dimorphic recombination, the vast majority of hotspots are shared between the sexes, with only a small number of putative sex-specific hotspots. Wavelet analysis indicates that most of the differences can be attributed to the fine scale, and that variation in rate between the sexes can mostly be explained by differences in hotspot magnitude, rather than location. Nonetheless, known recombination-associated genomic features, such as THE1B repeat elements, show systematic differences between the sexes., It is known that males have lower recombination rates than females over much of the genome but little is known about differences at a fine scale.

In mammals, the majority of recombination occurs at highly delimited 1\textendash{}2 kb long sites known as recombination hotspots, whose locations and activities are distributed unevenly along the chromosomes and are tightly regulated in a sex specific manner. The factors determining the location of hotspots started to emerge with the finding of PRDM9 as a major hotspot regulator in mammals, however, additional factors modulating hotspot activity and sex specificity are yet to be defined. To address this limitation, we have collected and mapped the locations of 4829 crossover events occurring on mouse chromosome 11 in 5858 meioses of male and female reciprocal F1 hybrids of C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ mice. This chromosome was chosen for its medium size and high gene density and provided a comparison with our previous analysis of recombination on the longest mouse chromosome 1. Crossovers were mapped to an average resolution of 127 kb, and thirteen hotspots were mapped to {$<$}8 kb. Most crossovers occurred in a small number of the most active hotspots. Females had higher recombination rate than males as a consequence of differences in crossover interference and regional variation of sex specific rates along the chromosome. Comparison with chromosome 1 showed that recombination events tend to be positioned in similar fashion along the centromere-telomere axis but independently of the local gene density. It appears that mammalian recombination is regulated on at least three levels, chromosome-wide, regional, and at individual hotspots, and these regulation levels are influenced by sex and genetic background but not by gene content.},

COs exhibit interference; they are more evenly spaced along the chromosomes than would be expected if they were placed randomly. The protein complexes involved in recombination can be visualized as immunofluorescent foci. We have analyzed the distribution of such foci along meiotic prophase chromosomes of the mouse to find out when interference is imposed and whether interference manifests itself at a constant level during meiosis. We observed strong interference among MLH1 foci, which mark CO positions in pachytene. Additionally, we detected substantial interference well before this point, in late zygotene, among MSH4 foci, and similarly, among replication protein A (RPA) foci. MSH4 foci and RPA foci both mark interhomolog recombinational interactions, most of which do not yield COs in the mouse. Furthermore, this zygotene interference did not depend on SYCP1, which is a transverse filament protein of mouse synaptonemal complexes. Interference is thus not specific to COs but may occur in other situations in which the spatial distribution of events has to be controlled. Differences between the distributions of MSH4/RPA foci and MLH1 foci along synaptonemal complexes might suggest that CO interference occurs in two successive steps.},

DSBs usually occur in intergenic regions that display nuclease hypersensitivity in digests of chromatin. DSBs are distributed nonuniformly across chromosomes; on chromosome III, DSBs are concentrated in two "hot" regions, one in each chromosome arm. DSBs occur rarely in regions within about 40 kb of each telomere and in an 80-kb region in the center of the chromosome, just to the right of the centromere. We used recombination reporter inserts containing arg4 mutant alleles to show that the "cold" properties of the central DSB-deficient region are imposed on DNA inserted in the region. Cold region inserts display DSB and recombination frequencies that are substantially less than those seen with similar inserts in flanking hot regions. This occurs without apparent change in chromatin structure, as the same pattern and level of DNase I hypersensitivity is seen in chromatin of hot and cold region inserts. These data are consistent with the suggestion that features of higher-order chromosome structure or chromosome dynamics act in a target sequence-independent manner to control where recombination events initiate during meiosis.},

The prototype KRAB domain initially identified in ZNF10/KOX1 encompasses two subdomains A and B that are found in hundreds of zinc finger transcription factors studied in human and murine genomes. Here we demonstrate for the first time transcriptional repressor activity of an amphibian KRAB domain. After sequence correction, the updated KRAB-AB domain of zinc finger protein XFIN from the frog Xenopus laevis was found to confer transcriptional repression in reporter assays in Xenopus laevis A6 kidney cells as well as in human HeLa, but not in the minnow Pimephales promelas fish cell line EPC. Binding of the XFIN KRAB-AB domain to human TRIM28 was demonstrated in a classical co-immunoprecipitation approach and visualized in a single-cell compartmentalization assay. XFIN-AB displayed reduced potency in repression as well as lower strength of interaction with TRIM28 compared to ZNF10 KRAB-AB. KRAB-B subdomain swapping between the two KRAB domains indicated that it was mainly the KRAB-B subdomain of XFIN that was responsible for its lower capacity in repression and binding to human TRIM28. In EPC fish cells, ZNF10 and XFIN KRAB repressor activity could be partially restored to low levels by adding exogenous human TRIM28. In contrast to XFIN, we did not find any transcriptional repression activity for the KRAB-like domain of human PRDM9 in HeLa cells. PRDM9 is thought to harbor an evolutionary older domain related to KRAB whose homologs even occur in invertebrates. Our results support the notion that functional bona fide KRAB domains which confer transcriptional repression and interact with TRIM28 most likely co-evolved together with TRIM28 at the beginning of tetrapode evolution.},

It is an important mammalian model of chromosomal and genome evolution as it is one of the few species with a complete genome sequence. Here we generate a high-precision cytological recombination map for the species, the third such map produced in mammals, following those for humans and house mice. We prepared synaptonemal complex (SC) spreads of meiotic chromosomes from 638 spermatocytes of 22 males of nine different Robertsonian karyotypes, identifying each autosome arm by differential DAPI staining. Altogether we mapped 13,983 recombination sites along 7095 individual autosomes, using immunolocalization of MLH1, a mismatch repair protein marking recombination sites. We estimated the total recombination length of the shrew genome as 1145 cM. The majority of bivalents showed a high recombination frequency near the telomeres and a low frequency near the centromeres. The distances between MLH1 foci were consistent with crossover interference both within chromosome arms and across the centromere in metacentric bivalents. The pattern of recombination along a chromosome arm was a function of its length, interference, and centromere and telomere effects. The specific DNA sequence must also be important because chromosome arms of the same length differed substantially in their recombination pattern. These features of recombination show great similarity with humans and mice and suggest generality among mammals. However, contrary to a widespread perception, the metacentric bivalent tu usually lacked an MLH1 focus on one of its chromosome arms, arguing against a minimum requirement of one chiasma per chromosome arm for correct segregation. With regard to autosomal chromosomal variation, the chromosomes showing Robertsonian polymorphism display MLH1 foci that become increasingly distal when comparing acrocentric homozygotes, heterozygotes, and metacentric homozygotes. Within the sex trivalent XY1Y2, the autosomal part of the complex behaves similarly to other autosomes.},

The basic principle of the mapping scheme is to develop, by recombinant DNA techniques, random single-copy DNA probes capable of detecting DNA sequence polymorphisms, when hybridized to restriction digests of an individual's DNA. Each of these probes will define a locus. Loci can be expanded or contracted to include more or less polymorphism by further application of recombinant DNA technology. Suitably polymorphic loci can be tested for linkage relationships in human pedigrees by established methods; and loci can be arranged into linkage groups to form a true genetic map of "DNA marker loci." Pedigrees in which inherited traits are known to be segregating can then be analyzed, making possible the mapping of the gene(s) responsible for the trait with respect to the DNA marker loci, without requiring direct access to a specified gene's DNA. For inherited diseases mapped in this way, linked DNA marker loci can be used predictively for genetic counseling.},

  abstract = {Studies of meiotic recombination have revealed an evolutionary paradox. Molecular and genetic analysis has shown that crossing over initiates at specific sites called hotspots, by a recombinational-repair mechanism in which the initiating hotspot is replaced by a copy of its homolog. We have used computer simulations of large populations to show that this mechanism causes active hotspot alleles to be rapidly replaced by inactive alleles, which arise by rare mutation and increase by recombination-associated conversion. Additional simulations solidified the paradox by showing that the known benefits of recombination appear inadequate to maintain its mechanism. Neither the benefits of accurate segregation nor those of recombining flanking genes were sufficient to preserve active alleles in the face of conversion. A partial resolution to this paradox was obtained by introducing into the model an additional, nonmeiotic function for the sites that initiate recombination, consistent with the observed association of hotspots with functional sites in chromatin. Provided selection for this function was sufficiently strong, active hotspots were able to persist in spite of frequent conversion to inactive alleles. However, this explanation is unsatisfactory for two reasons. First, it is unlikely to apply to obligately sexual species, because observed crossover frequencies imply maintenance of many hotspots per genome, and the viability selection needed to preserve these would drive the species to extinction. Second, it fails to explain why such a genetically costly mechanism of recombination has been maintained over evolutionary time. Thus the paradox persists and is likely to be resolved only by significant changes to the commonly accepted mechanism of crossing over.},

  abstract = {Genetic recombination occurs during meiosis, the key developmental program of gametogenesis. Recombination in mammals has been recently linked to the activity of a histone H3 methyl-transferase, PRDM9\textendash, the product of the only known speciation gene in mammals. PRDM9 is thought to determine the preferred recombination sites \textendash{} recombination hotspots \textendash{} through sequence-specific binding of its highly polymorphic multi-Zn-finger domain. Nevertheless, Prdm9 knockout mice are proficient at initiating recombination . Here we map and analyze the genome-wide distribution of recombination initiation sites in Prdm9 knockout mice and in two mouse strains with different Prdm9 alleles and their F1 hybrid. We show that PRDM9 determines the positions of practically all hotspots in the mouse genome, with the remarkable exception of the pseudoautosomal region \textendash{} the only area of the genome that undergoes recombination in 100\% of cells. Surprisingly, hotspots are still observed in Prdm9 knockout mice and as in wild-type, these hotspots are found at H3K4 trimethylation marks. However, in the absence of PRDM9, the majority of recombination is initiated at promoters and at other sites of PRDM9-independent H3K4 trimethylation. Such sites are rarely targeted in wild-type mice indicating an unexpected role of the PRDM9 protein in sequestering the recombination machinery away from gene promoter regions and other functional genomic elements.},

Analysis of intercrossover distances was greatly superior to the analysis of crossover counts, in both demonstrating interference and distinguishing between the five models. In contrast to earlier suggestions, interference was found to continue uninterrupted across the centromeres. No convincing differences in the levels of interference were found between the sexes or among chromosomes; however, we did detect possible individual variation in interference among the eight mothers.

Accordingly, we recently initiated a study of synapsis in the human male, combining immunofluorescence and fluorescence in situ hybridization methodologies to analyze prophase spermatocytes from a series of control individuals. Our results indicate that synapsis is a tightly regulated process, with relatively little variation among individuals. On nonacrocentric chromosomes, there are two synaptic initiation sites, one on the distal short arm and one on the distal long arm, whereas acrocentric chromosomes exhibit a single site on the distal long arm. For both types of chromosomes, synapsis then proceeds toward the centromere, with little evidence that specific p- or q-arm sequences affect the process. However, the centromere appears to have an inhibitory effect on synapsis--that is, when one arm of a nonacrocentric chromosome is "zippered up" before the other, the centromere acts as a barrier to further movement from that arm.},

Several studies using different approaches have dramatically advanced our understanding of recombination hotspot regulation. Population genetic data have been used to map and quantify hotspots in the human genome. Genetic variation in recombination rates and hotspots usage have been explored in human pedigrees, mouse intercrosses, and by sperm typing. These studies pointed to the central role of the PRDM9 gene in hotspot modulation. In this study, we used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from whole-genome resequencing and genotyping studies of mouse inbred strains to estimate recombination rates across the mouse genome and identified 47,068 historical hotspots\textemdash{}an average of over 2477 per chromosome. We show by simulation that inbred mouse strains can be used to identify positions of historical hotspots. Recombination hotspots were found to be enriched for the predicted binding sequences for different alleles of the PRDM9 protein. Recombination rates were on average lower near transcription start sites (TSS). Comparing the inferred historical recombination hotspots with the recent genome-wide mapping of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mouse sperm revealed a significant overlap, especially toward the telomeres. Our results suggest that inbred strains can be used to characterize and study the dynamics of historical recombination hotspots. They also strengthen previous findings on mouse recombination hotspots, and specifically the impact of sequence variants in Prdm9.},

H3K4Me3, H3K4Me2 and H3K9Ac are specifically enriched in the chromatids that carry an active initiation site, and in the absence of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in Spo11-/- mice. We thus propose that these marks are part of the substrate for recombination initiation at the Psmb9 hotspot. In contrast, hyperacetylation of H4 is increased as a consequence of DSB formation, as shown by its dependency on Spo11 and by the enrichment detected on both recombining chromatids. In addition, the comparison with another hotspot, Hlx1, strongly suggests that H3K4Me3 and H4 hyperacetylation are common features of DSB formation and repair, respectively. Altogether, the chromatin signatures of the Psmb9 and Hlx1 hotspots provide a basis for understanding the distribution of meiotic recombination.},

High polymorphism and rapid divergence of the Prdm9 gene ZnF domain appear to involve positive selection at DNA-recognition amino-acid positions, but the nature of the underlying evolutionary pressures remains a puzzle. Here we explore the variability of the Prdm9 ZnF array in wild mice, and uncovered a high allelic diversity of both ZnF copy number and identity with the caracterization of 113 alleles. We analyze features of the diversity of ZnF identity which is mostly due to non-synonymous changes at codons -1, 3 and 6 of each ZnF, corresponding to amino-acids involved in DNA binding. Using methods adapted to the minisatellite structure of the ZnF array, we infer a phylogenetic tree of these alleles. We find the sister species Mus spicilegus and M. macedonicus as well as the three house mouse (Mus musculus) subspecies to be polyphyletic. However some sublineages have expanded independently in Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus, the latter further showing phylogeographic substructure. Compared to random genomic regions and non-coding minisatellites, none of these patterns appears exceptional. In silico prediction of DNA binding sites for each allele, overlap of their alignments to the genome and relative coverage of the different families of interspersed repeated elements suggest a large diversity between PRDM9 variants with a potential for highly divergent distributions of recombination events in the genome with little correlation to evolutionary distance. By compiling PRDM9 ZnF protein sequences in Primates, Muridae and Equids, we find different diversity patterns among the three amino-acids most critical for the DNA-recognition function, suggesting different diversification timescales.},

In the present study, we have analyzed the formation and structure of the cleavage complex catalyzed by Sufolobus shibatae DNA topoisomerase VI (topoVI), a member of the recently described type IIB DNA topoisomerase family. A purification procedure of a fully soluble recombinant topoVI was developed by expressing both subunits simultaneously in Escherichia coli. Using this recombinant enzyme, we observed that the formation of the double-strand breaks on supercoiled or linear DNA is strictly dependent on the presence of ATP or AMP-PNP. This result suggests that ATP binding is required to stabilize an enzyme conformation able to cleave the DNA backbone. The structure of cleavage complexes on a linear DNA fragment have been analyzed at the nucleotide level. Similarly to other type II DNA topoisomerases, topoVI is covalently attached to the 5{${'}$}-ends of the broken DNA. However, sequence analysis of the double-strand breaks revealed that they are all characterized by staggered two-nucleotide long 5{${'}$} overhangs, contrasting with the four-base staggered double-strand breaks catalyzed by type IIA DNA topoisomerases. While no clear consensus sequences surrounding the cleavage sites could be described, interestingly A and T nucleotides are highly represented on the 5{${'}$} extensions, giving a first insight on the preferred sequences recognized by this type II DNA topoisomerase.},

  abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are formed by the Spo11 protein, initiate meiotic recombination. Previous DSB-mapping studies have used rad50S or sae2Delta mutants, which are defective in break processing, to accumulate Spo11-linked DSBs, and report large ({$>$} or = 50 kb) "DSB-hot" regions that are separated by "DSB-cold" domains of similar size. Substantial recombination occurs in some DSB-cold regions, suggesting that DSB patterns are not normal in rad50S or sae2Delta mutants. We therefore developed a novel method to map genome-wide, single-strand DNA (ssDNA)-associated DSBs that accumulate in processing-capable, repair-defective dmc1Delta and dmc1Delta rad51Delta mutants. DSBs were observed at known hot spots, but also in most previously identified "DSB-cold" regions, including near centromeres and telomeres. Although approximately 40\% of the genome is DSB-cold in rad50S mutants, analysis of meiotic ssDNA from dmc1Delta shows that most of these regions have substantial DSB activity. Southern blot assays of DSBs in selected regions in dmc1Delta, rad50S, and wild-type cells confirm these findings. Thus, DSBs are distributed much more uniformly than was previously believed. Comparisons of DSB signals in dmc1, dmc1 rad51, and dmc1 spo11 mutant strains identify Dmc1 as a critical strand-exchange activity genome-wide, and confirm previous conclusions that Spo11-induced lesions initiate all meiotic recombination.},

I argue that ideas about the role of recombination in speciation should be considered in the context of the variability of recombination rates and patterns more generally and that genic as well as chromosomal causes of restricted recombination should be considered. I review patterns of variation in recombination rates and theoretical progress in understanding the conditions that favour increased or decreased rates. Although progress has been made in understanding conditions that alter overall rates of recombination, widespread variation in patterns of recombination remains largely unexplained. I consider three models for the role of locally restricted recombination in speciation and the evidence currently supporting them.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination in mammals has been shown to largely cluster into hotspots, which are targeted by the chromatin modifier PRDM9. The canid family, including wolves and dogs, has undergone a series of disrupting mutations in this gene, rendering PRDM9 inactive. Given the importance of PRDM9, it is of great interest to learn how its absence in the dog genome affects patterns of recombination placement. We have used genotypes from domestic dog pedigrees to generate sex-specific genetic maps of recombination in this species. On a broad scale, we find that placement of recombination events in dogs is consistent with that in mice and apes, in that the majority of recombination occurs toward the telomeres in males, while female crossing over is more frequent and evenly spread along chromosomes. It has been previously suggested that dog recombination is more uniform in distribution than that of humans; however, we found that recombination in dogs is less uniform than in humans. We examined the distribution of recombination within the genome, and found that recombination is elevated immediately upstream of the transcription start site and around CpG islands, in agreement with previous studies, but that this effect is stronger in male dogs. We also found evidence for positive crossover interference influencing the spacing between recombination events in dogs, as has been observed in other species including humans and mice. Overall our data suggests that dogs have similar broad scale properties of recombination to humans, while fine scale recombination is similar to other species lacking PRDM9.},

In order to shed light on this intriguing evolutionary process, here we present a detailed empirical study that shows how Robertsonian (Rb) fusions alter the chromosomal distribution of recombination events during the formation of the germline in a Rb system of the western house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus). Our results indicate that both the total number of meiotic crossovers and the chromosomal distribution of recombination events are reduced in mice with Rb fusions and that this can be related to alterations in epigenetic signatures for heterochromatinization. Furthermore, we detected novel house mouse Prdm9 allelic variants in the Rb system. Remarkably, mean recombination rates were positively correlated with a decrease in the number of ZnF domains in the Prdm9 gene. The suggestion that recombination can be modulated by both chromosomal reorganizations and genetic determinants that control the formation of double-stranded breaks during meiosis opens new avenues for understanding the role of recombination in chromosomal speciation.},

Determining by which mechanisms genetic variation is generated and maintained across different phylogenetic groups provides the basis for our understanding of biodiversity and evolution. In this review, we go through different aspects of this essential phenomenon, paying special attention to mammals. We provide a comprehensive view on the organization of meiotic chromosomes and the mechanisms involved in the formation and genomic distribution of recombination hotspots, focusing on the factors influencing the formation and repair of the massive amount of self-induced DNA breaks in early stages of meiosis. At the same time, we discuss the genetic and mechanistic factors that influence recombination landscapes in mammals, as reflected by several layers of regulation. These factors include the selective forces that affect the DNA sequence itself, which can be modulated by genome reshuffling and the evolutionary history of each taxon, and the forces that control how the DNA is packaged into chromosomes during meiosis.},

These DNA polymorphisms show two clusters of high nonrandom associations, one 5' and another 3' to the beta-globin structural gene, with no significant linkage disequilibrium between the two clusters. The 5'- and 3'-association clusters are 34.6 kilobases (kb) and 19.4 kb long, respectively, and are separated by 9.1 kb of DNA immediately 5' to the beta-globin gene. For each of these three DNA regions, we have observed a relationship between nonrandom associations and physical distance between the polymorphisms. However, this relationship differed for each of these regions. On the assumption that the effective population size (Ne) is 5,000-50,000, we estimate the total recombination rate to be 0.0017\%-0.0002\% in the 5' cluster, 0.0931\%-0.0093\% in the 3' cluster, and 0.2912\%-0.0219\% in the 9.1-kb region between them. The beta cluster thus shows nonuniformity in recombination. Moreover, the recombination rate in the 9.1-kb DNA segment is 3-30 times greater than expected and is thus a hot spot for meiotic recombination.},

Black populations are polymorphic for all five markers, whereas the other groups are polymorphic for Rsa I, Taq I, and 5' FP only. The data suggest that approximately equal to 1 in 550 base pairs is variant in this region. The polymorphisms, even though located within 20 kilobases, display low levels of nonrandom association. Population genetic analysis suggests that recombination within this 20-kilobase segment occurs 24 times more frequently than expected if crossing-over occurred uniformly throughout the human genome. These findings suggest that population associations between DNA polymorphisms and disease susceptibility genes near the insulin gene or structural mutations in the insulin gene will be weak. Thus, population studies would probably require large sample sizes to detect associations. However, the low levels of nonrandom association increase the information content of the locus for linkage studies, which is the best alternative for discovering disease susceptibility genes.},

two demes were studied by multi-locus stochastic simulations. The model
includes deleterious mutations at loci throughout the
genome, causing `background selection', as well as a single
locus at which a polymorphism is
maintained, either by frequency-dependent selection or by local
selective differences. These
balanced polymorphisms induce long coalescence times at linked neutral
loci, so that sequence
diversity at these loci is enhanced at statistical equilibrium. We study
how
equilibrium neutral
diversity levels are affected by the degree of population subdivision,
the
presence or absence of
background selection, and the level of inbreeding of the population. The
simulation results are
compared with approximate analytical formulae, assuming the infinite
sites neutral model. We
discuss how balancing selection can be distinguished from local selection,
by determining whether
peaks of diversity in the region of the polymorphic locus are seen within
or between demes. The
width of such diversity peaks is shown to depend on the total species
population size, rather than
local deme sizes. We show that, with population subdivision, local
selection enhances between-deme diversity even at neutral sites distant
from
the polymorphic locus, producing higher FST
values than with no selection; very high values can be generated at sites
close to a selected locus.
Background selection also increases FST,
mainly because of decreased diversity within populations,
which implies that its effects may be distinguishable from those of local
selection. Both effects are
stronger in selfing than outcrossing populations. Linkage disequilibrium
between neutral sites is
generated by both balancing and local selection, especially in selfing
populations, because of
linkage disequilibrium between the neutral sites and the selectively
maintained alleles. We discuss
how these theoretical results can be related to data on genetic diversity
within and between local populations of a species.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination initiates from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by SPO11 topoisomerase-like complexes. Meiotic DSB frequency varies extensively along eukaryotic chromosomes, with hotspots controlled by chromatin and DNA sequence. To map meiotic DSBs throughout a plant genome, we purified and sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana SPO11-1-oligonucleotides. SPO11-1-oligos are elevated in gene promoters, terminators, and introns, which is driven by AT-sequence richness that excludes nucleosomes and allows SPO11-1 access. A positive relationship was observed between SPO11-1-oligos and crossovers genome-wide, although fine-scale correlations were weaker. This may reflect the influence of interhomolog polymorphism on crossover formation, downstream from DSB formation. Although H3K4me3 is enriched in proximity to SPO11-1-oligo hotspots at gene 5' ends, H3K4me3 levels do not correlate with DSBs. Repetitive transposons are thought to be recombination silenced during meiosis, to prevent nonallelic interactions and genome instability. Unexpectedly, we found high SPO11-1-oligo levels in nucleosome-depleted Helitron/Pogo/Tc1/Mariner DNA transposons, whereas retrotransposons were coldspots. High SPO11-1-oligo transposons are enriched within gene regulatory regions and in proximity to immunity genes, suggesting a role as recombination enhancers. As transposon mobility in plant genomes is restricted by DNA methylation, we used the met1 DNA methyltransferase mutant to investigate the role of heterochromatin in SPO11-1-oligo distributions. Epigenetic activation of meiotic DSBs in proximity to centromeres and transposons occurred in met1 mutants, coincident with reduced nucleosome occupancy, gain of transcription, and H3K4me3. Together, our work reveals a complex relationship between chromatin and meiotic DSBs within A. thaliana genes and transposons, with significance for the diversity and evolution of plant genomes.},

Meiotic recombination is initiated by double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by the SPO11 transesterase. In yeast and worms, at least one buffering mechanism, crossover homeostasis, maintains crossover numbers despite variation in DSB numbers\textendash. We show here that mammals display progressive homeostatic control of recombination. In wild-type mouse spermatocytes, focus numbers for early recombination proteins (RAD51, DMC1) were highly variable from cell to cell, whereas foci of the crossover marker MLH1 showed little variability. Furthermore, mice with greater or fewer copies of the Spo11 gene \textemdash{} with correspondingly greater or fewer numbers of early recombination foci \textemdash{} displayed relatively invariant crossover numbers. Homeostatic control is enforced during at least two stages, after the formation of early recombination intermediates and later while these intermediates mature toward crossovers. Thus, variability within the mammalian meiotic program is robustly managed by homeostatic mechanisms to control crossover formation, probably to suppress aneuploidy. Meiotic recombination exemplifies how order can be progressively implemented in a self-organizing system despite natural cell-to-cell disparities in the underlying biochemical processes.},

  abstract = {The ability to examine all chromatids from a single meiosis in yeast tetrads has been indispensable for defining the mechanisms of homologous recombination initiated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Using a broadly applicable strategy for the analysis of chromatids from a single meiosis at two recombination hotspots in mouse oocytes and spermatocytes, we demonstrate here the unidirectional transfer of information-gene conversion-in both crossovers and noncrossovers. Whereas gene conversion in crossovers is associated with reciprocal exchange, the unbroken chromatid is not altered in noncrossover gene conversion events, providing strong evidence that noncrossovers arise from a distinct pathway. Gene conversion frequently spares the binding site of the hotspot-specifying protein PRDM9, with the result that erosion of the hotspot is slowed. Thus, mouse tetrad analysis demonstrates how unique aspects of mammalian recombination mechanisms shape hotspot evolutionary dynamics.},

  abstract = {Recombination is a fundamental biological process with profound evolutionary implications. Theory predicts that recombination increases the effectiveness of selection in natural populations. Yet, direct tests of this prediction have been restricted to qualitative trends due to the lack of detailed characterization of recombination rate variation across genomes and within species. The use of imprecise recombination rates can also skew population genetic analyses designed to assess the presence and mode of selection across genomes. Here we report the first integrated high-resolution description of genomic and population variation in recombination, which also distinguishes between the two outcomes of meiotic recombination: crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC). We characterized the products of 5,860 female meioses in Drosophila melanogaster by genotyping a total of 139 million informative SNPs and mapped 106,964 recombination events at a resolution down to 2 kilobases. This approach allowed us to generate whole-genome CO and GC maps as well as a detailed description of variation in recombination among individuals of this species. We describe many levels of variation in recombination rates. At a large-scale (100 kb), CO rates exhibit extreme and highly punctuated variation along chromosomes, with hot and coldspots. We also show extensive intra-specific variation in CO landscapes that is associated with hotspots at low frequency in our sample. GC rates are more uniformly distributed across the genome than CO rates and detectable in regions with reduced or absent CO. At a local scale, recombination events are associated with numerous sequence motifs and tend to occur within transcript regions, thus suggesting that chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. All these non-independent layers of variation in recombination across genomes and among individuals need to be taken into account in order to obtain relevant estimates of recombination rates, and should be included in a new generation of population genetic models of the interaction between selection and linkage.},

For example, hotspot locations are not shared between human and chimpanzee. Biased gene conversion in favor of alleles that locally disrupt hotspots is a possible explanation of the short lifespan of hotspots. We investigate the implications of such a bias on human hotspots and their evolution. Our results demonstrate that gene conversion bias is a sufficiently strong force to produce the observed lack of sharing of intense hotspots between species, although sharing may be much more common for weaker hotspots. We investigate models of how hotspots arise, and find that only models in which hotspot alleles do not initially experience drive are consistent with observations of rather hot hotspots in the human genome. Mutations acting against drive cannot successfully introduce such hotspots into the population, even if there is direct selection for higher recombination rates, such as to ensure correct segregation during meiosis. We explore the impact of hotspot alleles on patterns of haplotype variation, and show that such alleles mask their presence in population genetic data, making them difficult to detect.},

  abstract = {Recombination plays a crucial role in meiosis, ensuring the proper segregation of chromosomes. Recent linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sperm-typing studies suggest that recombination rates vary tremendously across the human genome, with most events occurring in narrow ``hotspots.'' To examine variation in fine-scale recombination patterns among individuals, we used dense, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data collected in nuclear families to localize crossovers with high spatial resolution. This analysis revealed that overall recombination hotspot usage is similar in males and females, with individual hotspots often active in both sexes. Across the genome, roughly 60\% of crossovers occurred in hotspots inferred from LD studies. Notably, however, we found extensive and heritable variation among both males and females in the proportion of crossovers occurring in these hotspots.
High-density genotyping of individuals from 82 families shows unexpected variation in the number of meiotic crossovers and in the relative activity of recombination hotspots.

  abstract = {Many genomic methodologies rely on the presence and extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and genetic variants underlying traits of interest, but the extent of LD in the horse has yet to be comprehensively characterized. In this study, we evaluate the extent and decay of LD in a sample of 817 Thoroughbreds. Horses were genotyped for over 50 000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers across the genome, with 34 848 autosomal SNPs used in the final analysis. Linkage disequilibrium, as measured by the squared correlation coefficient (r2), was found to be relatively high between closely linked markers ({$>$}0.6 at 5 kb) and to extend over long distances, with average r2 maintained above non-syntenic levels for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) up to 20 Mb apart. Using formulae which relate expected LD to effective population size (Ne), and assuming a constant actual population size, Ne was estimated to be 100 in our population. Values of historical Ne, calculated assuming linear population growth, suggested a decrease in Ne since the distant past, reaching a minimum twenty generations ago, followed by a subsequent increase until the present time. The qualitative trends observed in Ne can be rationalized by current knowledge of the history of the Thoroughbred breed, and inbreeding statistics obtained from published pedigree analyses are in agreement with observed values of Ne. Given the high LD observed and the small estimated Ne, genomic methodologies such as genomic selection could feasibly be applied to this population using the existing SNP marker set.},

However, in the age of whole-genome sequences, physical distances measured in base pairs of DNA provide the standard coordinates for navigating the myriad features of genomes. Although genetic and physical maps are colinear, there are well-characterized and sometimes dramatic heterogeneities in the average frequency of meiotic recombination events that occur along the physical extent of chromosomes. There also are documented differences in the recombination landscape between the two sexes. We have revisited high-resolution genetic map data from a large heterogeneous mouse population and have constructed a revised genetic map of the mouse genome, incorporating 10,195 single nucleotide polymorphisms using a set of 47 families comprising 3546 meioses. The revised map provides a different picture of recombination in the mouse from that reported previously. We have further integrated the genetic and physical maps of the genome and incorporated SSLP markers from other genetic maps into this new framework. We demonstrate that utilization of the revised genetic map improves QTL mapping, partially due to the resolution of previously undetected errors in marker ordering along the chromosome.},

Sperm-typing experiments4,5,6 have characterized regions where crossovers cluster into 1\textendash{}2-kb hot spots, but technical difficulties limit the number of studies7. An alternative is to use population variation to infer fine-scale characteristics of the recombination process. Several surveys8,9,10 reported 'block-like' patterns of diversity, which may reflect fine-scale recombination rate variation11,12,13, but limitations of available methods made this impossible to assess. Here, we applied a new statistical method, which overcomes these limitations, to infer patterns of fine-scale recombination rate variation in 74 genes. We found extensive rate variation both within and among genes. In particular, recombination hot spots are a common feature of the human genome: 47\% (35 of 74) of genes showed substantive evidence for a hot spot, and many more showed evidence for some rate variation. No primary sequence characteristics are consistently associated with precise hot-spot location, although G+C content and nucleotide diversity are correlated with local recombination rate.},

These extra COs arise not from the pathway that accounts for most of the COs in wild type, but from an alternate, normally minor pathway.

The Mus81 protein is required for resolution of joint molecules and the production of crossover DNA, providing further evidence that Mus81 is a component of a meiotic Holliday junction resolvase. Our results contrast with observations from budding yeast, which shows a preference for interhomolog over intersister events and generates primarily double Holliday junction intermediates.

Here we describe in fission yeast the genome-wide distribution of meiosis-specific Rec12-DNA linkages, which closely parallel DSBs measured by conventional Southern blot hybridization. Prominent DSB hotspots are located {$\sim$}65 kb apart, separated by intervals with little or no detectable breakage. Most hotspots lie within exceptionally large intergenic regions. Thus, the chromosomal architecture responsible for hotspots in fission yeast is markedly different from that of budding yeast, in which DSB hotspots are much more closely spaced and, in many regions of the genome, occur at each promoter.

  abstract = {During meiosis, homologous chromosomes (homologs) perform reciprocal exchanges (crossovers) at a high frequency. Crossovers display interference, i.e. their spacing is more even than would be expected if they were placed randomly along the chromosomes. Concomitantly with crossover formation, synaptonemal complexes (SCs) appear between homologs: each chromosome forms an axial structure, the axial element (AE); the AEs of homologs align, and numerous transverse filaments connect the AEs to form an SC. Both the AE and the SC have been implicated in the imposition of interference. We investigated whether intact AEs or SCs are required for crossover interference in the mouse, using a mutant lacking AE protein SYCP3, which displays structurally abnormal AEs and incomplete synapsis. We estimated the level of interference from the spacing of immunofluorescent MLH1 foci, which mark almost all crossover sites in the mouse, along the SCs. The levels of interference among MLH1 foci in wild-type and Sycp3\textquestiondown/\textquestiondown{} mice were comparable, implying that neither an intact AE structure nor full synapsis is required for wild-type levels of interferenc},

We have found that meiotic double-strand break sites (DSBs) colocalize with nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) and that large IGRs include clusters of NDRs that overlap with almost half of all DSBs. By contrast, ORIs do not colocalize with NDRs and they are regulated independently of DSBs. Physical relocation of NDRs at ectopic loci or modification of their genomic distribution during meiosis was paralleled by the generation of new DSB sites. Over 80\% of all meiotic DSBs colocalize with NDRs that are also present during mitosis, indicating that the recombination pattern is largely dependent on constitutive properties of the genome and, to a lesser extent, on the transcriptional profile during meiosis. The organization of ORIs and of DSBs regions in S. pombe reveals similarities and differences relative to Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

The programmed formation of hundreds of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is essential for proper meiosis and fertility. In mice and humans, the location of these breaks is determined by the meiosis-specific protein PRDM9, through the DNA-binding specificity of its zinc-finger domain. PRDM9 also has methyltransferase activity. Here, we show that this activity is required for H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 deposition and for DSB formation at PRDM9-binding sites. By analyzing mice that express two PRDM9 variants with distinct DNA-binding specificities, we show that each variant generates its own set of H3K4me3 marks independently from the other variant. Altogether, we reveal several basic principles of PRDM9-dependent DSB site determination, in which an excess of sites are designated through PRDM9 binding and subsequent histone methylation, from which a subset is selected for DSB formation.},

Here, we examine whether recombination is also unevenly distributed within the bz gene. In yeast genes, recombination (conversion) is polarized, being higher at the end of the gene where recombination is presumably initiated. We have analyzed products of meiotic recombination between heteroallelic pairs of bz mutations in both the presence and absence of heterologies and have sequenced the recombination junction in 130 such Bz intragenic recombinants. We have found that in the absence of heterologies, recombination is proportional to physical distance across the bz gene. The simplest interpretation for this lack of polarity is that recombination is initiated randomly within the gene. Insertion mutations affect the frequency and distribution of intragenic recombination events at bz, creating hotspots and coldspots. Single base pair heterologies also affect recombination, with fewer recombination events than expected by chance occurring in regions of the bz gene with a high density of heterologies. We also provide evidence that meiotic recombination in maize is conservative, that is, it does not introduce changes, and that meiotic conversion tracts are continuous and similar in size to those in yeast.},

To examine this effect, we compared recombination in the same genetic interval with and without a large retrotransposon cluster. We used three different bz1 locus haplotypes, McC, B73, and W22, in the same genetic background. We analyzed recombination between the bz1 and stc1 markers in heterozygotes that differ by the presence and absence of a 26-kb intergenic retrotransposon cluster. To facilitate the genetic screen, we used Ds and Ac markers that allowed us to identify recombinants by their seed pigmentation. We sequenced 239 recombination junctions and assigned them to a single nucleotide polymorphism-delimited interval in the region. The genetic distance between the markers was twofold smaller in the presence of the retrotransposon cluster. The reduction was seen in bz1 and stc1, but no recombination occurred in the highly polymorphic intergenic region of either heterozygote. Recombination within genes shuffled flanking retrotransposon clusters, creating new chimeric haplotypes and either contracting or expanding the physical distance between markers. Our findings imply that haplotype structure will profoundly affect the correlation between genetic and physical distance for the same interval in maize.},

We genotyped 71 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the entire chromosome 4 of Arabidopsis thaliana on 702 F2 plants, representing 1404 meioses and allowing the detection of 1171 COs, to study CO localization in a higher plant. The genetic recombination rates varied along the chromosome from 0 cM/Mb near the centromere to 20 cM/Mb on the short arm next to the NOR region, with a chromosome average of 4.6 cM/Mb. Principal component analysis showed that CO rates negatively correlate with the G+C content (P =3\texttimes{}10-4), in contrast to that reported in other eukaryotes. COs also significantly correlate with the density of single repeats and the CpG ratio, but not with genes, pseudogenes, transposable elements, or dispersed repeats. Chromosome 4 has, on average, 1.6 COs per meiosis, and these COs are subjected to interference. A detailed analysis of several regions having high CO rates revealed ``hot spots'' of meiotic recombination contained in small fragments of a few kilobases. Both the intensity and the density of these hot spots explain the variation of CO rates along the chromosome.},

In this study, we determined the CO distribution along the entire Arabidopsis thaliana Chromosome 4 (18 Mb) in male and female meiosis, using high density genetic maps built on large backcross populations (44 markers, {$>$}1,300 plants). We observed dramatic differences between male and female map lengths that were calculated as 88 cM and 52 cM, respectively. This difference is remarkably parallel to that between the total synaptonemal complex lengths measured in male and female meiocytes by immunolabeling of ZYP1 (a component of the synaptonemal complex). Moreover, CO landscapes were clearly different: in particular, at both ends of the map, male CO rates were higher (up to 4-fold the mean value), whereas female CO rates were equal or even below the chromosomal average. This unique material gave us the opportunity to perform a detailed analysis of CO interference on Chromosome 4 in male and female meiosis. The number of COs per chromosome and the distances between them clearly departs from randomness. Strikingly, the interference level (measured by coincidence) varied significantly along the chromosome in male meiosis and was correlated to the physical distance between COs. The significance of this finding on the relevance of current CO interference models is discussed.},

Males and females of two chromosomal races from Tunisia differing by nine pairs of Robertsonian (Rb) fusions (standard all-acrocentric, 2N = 40 and 2N = 22) were studied. A significant decrease in chiasma number (CN) was observed in Rb mice compared to standard ones for both sexes. The difference in CN was due to a reduction in the number of proximal chiasmata and was associated with an overall more distal redistribution. These features were related to distance of chiasmata to the centromere, suggesting that the centromere effect was more pronounced in Rb fusions than in acrocentric chromosomes. These modifications were interpreted in terms of structural meiotic constraints, although genic factors were likely involved in patterning the observed differences between sexes within races. Thus, the change in chromosomal structure in Rb mice was associated with a generalized decrease in recombination due to a reduction in diploid number, a lower CN, and a decrease in the efficiency of recombination. The effects of such modifications on patterns of genic diversity are discussed in the light of models of evolution of recombination.},

Despite the significance of this observation for evolutionary biology and genetics, the evolutionary mechanisms that contribute to these interspecific differences are unclear. On fine physical scales, recombination rates appear to evolve rapidly between closely related species, but the mode and tempo of recombination rate evolution on the broader scale is poorly understood. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to begin to characterize the evolutionary processes underlying average genomic recombination rates in mammals. We document a strong phylogenetic effect in recombination rates, indicating that more closely related species tend to have more similar average rates of recombination. We demonstrate that this phylogenetic signal is not an artifact of errors in recombination rate estimation and show that it is robust to uncertainty in the mammalian phylogeny. Neutral evolutionary models present good fits to the data and we find no evidence for heterogeneity in the rate of evolution in recombination across the mammalian tree. These results suggest that observed interspecific variation in average genomic rates of recombination is largely attributable to the steady accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time. Although single recombination hotspots may live and die on short evolutionary time scales, the strong phylogenetic signal in genomic recombination rates indicates that the pace of evolution on this scale may be considerably slower.},

Classical genetic experiments demonstrated a heritable component to population variation in recombination rate, and specific sequence variants that contribute to recombination rate differences between individuals have recently been identified. Despite these advances, the genetic basis of species divergence in recombination rate remains unexplored. Using a cytological assay that allows direct in situ imaging of recombination events in spermatocytes, we report a large ({$\sim$}30\%) difference in global recombination rate between males of two closely related house mouse subspecies (Mus musculus musculus and M. m. castaneus). To characterize the genetic basis of this recombination rate divergence, we generated an F2 panel of inter-subspecific hybrid males (n = 276) from an intercross between wild-derived inbred strains CAST/EiJ (M. m. castaneus) and PWD/PhJ (M. m. musculus). We uncover considerable heritable variation for recombination rate among males from this mapping population. Much of the F2 variance for recombination rate and a substantial portion of the difference in recombination rate between the parental strains is explained by eight moderate- to large-effect quantitative trait loci, including two transgressive loci on the X chromosome. In contrast to the rapid evolution observed in males, female CAST/EiJ and PWD/PhJ animals show minimal divergence in recombination rate ({$\sim$}5\%). The existence of loci on the X chromosome suggests a genetic mechanism to explain this male-biased evolution. Our results provide an initial map of the genetic changes underlying subspecies differences in genome-scale recombination rate and underscore the power of the house mouse system for understanding the evolution of this trait.},

In some mammalian species, however, the genomic distribution of crossovers is consistent with a more stringent baseline requirement of one crossover per chromosome arm. Given that the meiotic requirement for crossing over defines the minimum frequency of recombination necessary for the production of viable gametes, determining the chromosomal scale of this constraint is essential for defining crossover profiles predisposed to aneuploidy and understanding the parameters that shape patterns of recombination rate evolution across species. Here, I use cytogenetic methods for in situ imaging of crossovers in karyotypically diverse house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) and voles (genus Microtus) to test how chromosome number and configuration constrain the distribution of crossovers in a genome. I show that the global distribution of crossovers in house mice is thresholded by a minimum of one crossover per chromosome arm, whereas the crossover landscape in voles is defined by a more relaxed requirement of one crossover per chromosome. I extend these findings in an evolutionary metaanalysis of published recombination and karyotype data for 112 mammalian species and demonstrate that the physical scale of the genomic crossover distribution has undergone multiple independent shifts from one crossover per chromosome arm to one per chromosome during mammalian evolution. Together, these results indicate that the chromosomal scale constraint on crossover rates is itself a trait that evolves among species, a finding that casts light on an important source of crossover rate variation in mammals.},

In the majority of animal species examined crossing-over occurs in both sexes. While there is some tendency in mammals for crossover values in females to exceed those in males, it was of greater interest to find that marked sex-differences occur in the same species (data chiefly from the house mouse) in opposite directions in different chromosomes. The influence of factors acting locally in the chromosomes, such as those associated with hetero-chromatin, were indicated as promising subjects for the study of variations associated with sex.},

  abstract = {The number of possible meiotic segregations of paternal and maternal chromosomes is 2N (N = haploid chromosome number). In eutherian Mammals, where large variations of N exist, 2N may be very different in related species, genes, or families. For instance, in Cercopithecidae, species with the highest value (N = 36) make 2(15) = 32,768 more gametic chromosome combinations than those with the lowest value (N = 21). It is also shown that the number of chiasmata varies from species to species and is proportional to the haploid number of arms NF/2 of the karyotype. Thus, increase or decrease of both N and NF/2, often concomitant, both increase or decrease genetic mixing. The chromosomal phylogeny of Primates, Carnivora and Rodentia shows that pure dichotomic evolution is rare, at contrast with populational (non dichotomic) evolution which seems most frequent. In these Mammals, the few examples of dichotomic evolution are observed in groups with low values of N and NF/2. It is concluded that dichotomic evolution, which should be favoured by the transmission of groups of linked mutant alleles, is prevented, in most instances, by the high recombination rate in karyotypes with high values of N and NF/2. Thus the mode of speciation would depend on karyotype modifications by long term effects on population genetics, in addition to the immediate effects of gametic barriers due to chromosomal rearrangements in the heterozygous state.},

  abstract = {During meiosis, the formation of viable haploid gametes from diploid precursors requires that each homologous chromosome pair be properly segregated to produce an exact haploid set of chromosomes. Genetic recombination, which provides a physical connection between homologous chromosomes, is essential in most species for proper homologue segregation. Nevertheless, recombination is repressed specifically in and around the centromeres of chromosomes, apparently because rare centromeric (or pericentromeric) recombination events, when they do occur, can disrupt proper segregation and lead to genetic disabilities, including birth defects. The basis by which centromeric meiotic recombination is repressed has been largely unknown. We report here that, in fission yeast, RNAi functions and Clr4-Rik1 (histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase) are required for repression of centromeric recombination. Surprisingly, one mutant derepressed for recombination in the heterochromatic mating-type region during meiosis and several mutants derepressed for centromeric gene expression during mitotic growth are not derepressed for centromeric recombination during meiosis. These results reveal a complex relation between types of repression by heterochromatin. Our results also reveal a previously undemonstrated role for RNAi and heterochromatin in the repression of meiotic centromeric recombination and, potentially, in the prevention of birth defects by maintenance of proper chromosome segregation during meiosis.},

The observed relation between recombination frequency and sequence G + C content provides an elegant explanation of why gene density is higher in G + C rich isochores than in other parts of the genome, and why long interspersed elements (LINES) are exclusive to G + C poor isochores.

LD was measured between all marker pairs, both syntenic and nonsyntenic. Analysis of syntenic pairs revealed surprisingly high levels of LD that, although more pronounced for closely linked marker pairs, extended over several tens of centimorgan. In addition, significant gametic associations were also shown to be very common between nonsyntenic loci. Simulations using the known genealogies of the studied sample indicate that random drift alone is likely to account for most of the observed disequilibrium. No clear evidence was obtained for a direct effect of selection (``Bulmer effect''). The observation of long range disequilibrium between syntenic loci using low-density marker maps indicates that LD mapping has the potential to be very effective in livestock populations. The frequent occurrence of gametic associations between nonsyntenic loci, however, encourages the combined use of linkage and linkage disequilibrium methods to avoid false positive results when mapping genes in livestock.},

  abstract = {The Dobzhansky-Muller model of incompatibilities explains reproductive isolation between species by incorrect epistatic interactions. Although the mechanisms of speciation are of great interest, no incompatibility has been characterized at the gene level in mammals. The Hybrid sterility 1 gene (Hst1) participates in the arrest of meiosis in F1 males of certain strains from two Mus musculus subspecies, e.g., PWD from M. m. musculus and C57BL/6J (henceforth B6) from M. m. domesticus. Hst1 has been identified as a meiotic PR-domain gene (Prdm9) encoding histone 3 methyltransferase in the male offspring of PWD females and B6 males, (PWD\texttimes{}B6)F1. To characterize the incompatibilities underlying hybrid sterility, we phenotyped reproductive and meiotic markers in males with altered copy numbers of Prdm9. A partial rescue of fertility was observed upon removal of the B6 allele of Prdm9 from the azoospermic (PWD\texttimes{}B6)F1 hybrids, whereas removing one of the two Prdm9 copies in PWD or B6 background had no effect on male reproduction. Incompatibility(ies) not involving Prdm9B6 also acts in the (PWD\texttimes{}B6)F1 hybrids, since the correction of hybrid sterility by Prdm9B6 deletion was not complete. Additions and subtractions of Prdm9 copies, as well as allelic replacements, improved meiotic progression and fecundity also in the progeny-producing reciprocal (B6\texttimes{}PWD)F1 males. Moreover, an increased dosage of Prdm9 and reciprocal cross enhanced fertility of other sperm-carrying male hybrids, (PWD\texttimes{}B6-C3H.Prdm9)F1, harboring another Prdm9 allele of M. m. domesticus origin. The levels of Prdm9 mRNA isoforms were similar in the prepubertal testes of all types of F1 hybrids of PWD with B6 and B6-C3H.Prdm9 despite their different prospective fertility, but decreased to 53\% after removal of Prdm9B6. Therefore, the Prdm9B6 allele probably takes part in posttranscriptional dominant-negative hybrid interaction(s) absent in the parental strains., Disturbed gametogenesis in the progeny of two fertile parental forms is called hybrid sterility; it is an important part of reproductive barriers between species. The Dobzhansky-Muller model of incompatibilities explains reproductive isolation between species by incorrect interactions between genes. Hybrid sterility 1 (Hst1) is one of the genes causing meiotic arrest in F1 male hybrids between certain Mus musculus musculus (e.g., the PWD strain) and M. m. domesticus (C57BL/6J etc.) mice. Hst1, the first mammalian candidate for a speciation gene, was identified as a meiotic PR/SET-domain gene, Prdm9, but the mechanism causing sterility has remained unknown. While the F1 male offspring of C57BL/6J males and PWD females produce no sperm, the males from the reciprocal cross using PWD males and C57BL/6J females yield progeny. Here we show that the meiotic progress and fertility of hybrid males from both F1 crosses improved by removal as well as overexpression of the C57BL/6J allele of Prdm9, suggesting that Prdm9 interactions not present in the parental species (incompatibilities) play a role in hybrid sterility. Furthermore, the Prdm9 dosage also controlled fecundity in other F1 hybrids, indicating that this gene is an important regulator of mouse hybrid fertility.},

Characterizing this variation and identifying its determinants are essential steps in our understanding of the human recombination process and its evolution. Study Design/Results Using three large sets of European-American pedigrees, we examined variation in five recombination phenotypes that capture distinct aspects of crossing-over patterns. We found that the mean recombination rate in males and females and the historical hotspot usage are significantly heritable and are uncorrelated with one another. We then conducted a genome-wide association study in order to identify loci that influence them. We replicated associations of RNF212 with the mean rate in males and in females as well as the association of Inversion 17q21.31 with the female mean rate. We also replicated the association of PRDM9 with historical hotspot usage, finding that it explains most of the genetic variance in this phenotype. In addition, we identified a set of new candidate regions for further validation. Significance These findings suggest that variation at broad and fine scales is largely separable and that, beyond three known loci, there is no evidence for common variation with large effects on recombination phenotypes.},

The observed sterility is, by definition, hybrid sterility since both parental forms (i.e. wild and laboratory mice) are fully fertile, their male offspring displaying small testes with arrest of spermatogenesis at the stage of spermatogenesis or primary spermatocytes. Results of genetic analysis as well as the failure to detect any chromosomal rearrangements point to a genie rather than a chromosomal type of hybrid sterility.Fifty-three wild males were classified into three sets, after mating with C57BL/10 inbred females, according to the fertility of their male progeny (set I \textendash{} only sterile sons; set II \textendash{} only fertile sons; set III \textendash{} both fertile and sterile sons). The wild males of set I, which yield only sterile male offspring with C57BL/10 females, sire sterile sons also with females of the following inbred strains: A/Ph, BALB/c, DBA/1, and AKR/J, whereas the same wild males produce fertile offspring with females of C3H/Di, CBA/J, P/J, I/St and F/St inbred strains.The described hybrid sterility seems to be under the control of several independently segregating genes, one of them (proposed symbol Hst-1) being localized on chromosome 17 (linkage group IX), 6 cM distally from dominant T (Brachyury). A chance to search for the mechanism of hybrid sterility is provided by the finding of two laboratory inbred strains, C57BL/10 and C3H/Di, differing with respect to the Hybrid sterility genetic system only at the Hst-1 gene.Hst-1 is closely linked but apparently not identical with the sterility factor of recessive t alleles of the T locus.},

However, empirical evidence indicates that nascent hotspots are susceptible to removal due to biased gene conversion, so it is paradoxical that they should be so widespread. Previous modeling work has shown that hotspots can evolve due to genetic drift overpowering their intrinsic disadvantage. Here we synthesize recent theoretical and empirical results to show how natural selection can favor hotspots. We propose that hotspots are part of a cycle of antagonistic coevolution between two tightly linked chromosomal regions: an inducer region that initiates recombination during meiosis by cutting within a nearby region of DNA and the cut region itself, which can evolve to be resistant to cutting. Antagonistic coevolution between inducers and their cut sites is driven by recurrent episodes of Hill-Robertson interference, genetic hitchhiking, and biased gene conversion.},

To bridge this gap, we have generated the first cytological recombination map that identifies individual autosomes in the male mouse. We prepared meiotic chromosome (synaptonemal complex [SC]) spreads from 110 mouse spermatocytes, identified each autosome by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization of chromosome-specific DNA libraries, and mapped {$>$}2,000 sites of recombination along individual autosomes, using immunolocalization of MLH1, a mismatch repair protein that marks crossover sites. We show that SC length is strongly correlated with crossover frequency and distribution. Although the length of most SCs corresponds to that predicted from their mitotic chromosome length rank, several SCs are longer or shorter than expected, with corresponding increases and decreases in MLH1 frequency. Although all bivalents share certain general recombination features, such as few crossovers near the centromeres and a high rate of distal recombination, individual bivalents have unique patterns of crossover distribution along their length. In addition to SC length, other, as-yet-unidentified, factors influence crossover distribution leading to hot regions on individual chromosomes, with recombination frequencies as much as six times higher than average, as well as cold spots with no recombination. By reprobing the SC spreads with genetically mapped BACs, we demonstrate a robust strategy for integrating genetic linkage and physical contig maps with mitotic and meiotic chromosome structure.},

We first measured recombination across adjacent homozygous genetic intervals on either side of the bronze (bz) locus. We then isolated and characterized two bacterial artificial chromosome clones containing those intervals. Recombination was almost 2 orders of magnitude higher in the distal side, which is gene-dense and lacks retrotransposons, than in the proximal side, which is gene-poor and contains a large cluster of methylated retrotransposons. We conclude that the repetitive retrotransposon DNA in maize, which constitutes the bulk of the genome, most likely contributes little if any to genetic length.},

As part of The SNP Consortium Allele Frequency Projects, we characterized haplotype patterns across 51 autosomal regions (spanning 13 megabases of the human genome) in samples from Africa, Europe, and Asia. We show that the human genome can be parsed objectively into haplotype blocks: sizable regions over which there is little evidence for historical recombination and within which only a few common haplotypes are observed. The boundaries of blocks and specific haplotypes they contain are highly correlated across populations. We demonstrate that such haplotype frameworks provide substantial statistical power in association studies of common genetic variation across each region. Our results provide a foundation for the construction of a haplotype map of the human genome, facilitating comprehensive genetic association studies of human disease.},

Meiotic studies in mammalian species are scarce and mainly focused on human and mouse. Here, the meiotic recombination events were determined in three species of Platyrrhini monkeys (Cebus libidinosus, Cebus nigritus and Alouatta caraya) by analysing the distribution of MLH1 foci at the stage of pachytene. Moreover, the combination of immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridisation has enabled us to construct recombination maps of primate chromosomes that are homologous to human chromosomes 13 and 21. Our results show that (a) the overall number of MLH1 foci varies among all three species, (b) the presence of heterochromatin blocks does not have a major influence on the distribution of MLH1 foci and (c) the distribution of crossovers in the homologous chromosomes to human chromosomes 13 and 21 are conserved between species of the same genus (C. libidinosus and C. nigritus) but are significantly different between Cebus and Alouatta. This heterogeneity in recombination behaviour among Ceboidea species may reflect differences in genetic diversity and genome composition.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is a critical step in gametogenesis for many organisms, enabling the creation of genetically diverse haploid gametes. In each meiotic cell, recombination is initiated by numerous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) created by Spo11, the evolutionarily conserved topoisomerase-like protein, but how these DSBs are distributed relatively uniformly across the four chromatids that make up each chromosome pair is poorly understood. Here we employ Saccharomyces cerevisiae to demonstrate distance-dependent DSB interference in cis (in which the occurrence of a DSB suppresses adjacent DSB formation)--a process that is mediated by the conserved DNA damage response kinase, Tel1(ATM). The inhibitory function of Tel1 acts on a relatively local scale, while over large distances DSBs have a tendency to form independently of one another even in the presence of Tel1. Notably, over very short distances, loss of Tel1 activity causes DSBs to cluster within discrete zones of concerted DSB activity. Our observations support a hierarchical view of recombination initiation where Tel1(ATM) prevents clusters of DSBs, and further suppresses DSBs within the surrounding chromosomal region. Such collective negative regulation will help to ensure that recombination events are dispersed evenly and arranged optimally for genetic exchange and efficient chromosome segregation.},

During mitotic cell divisions, sister chromatids separate from each other to opposite poles, resulting in two daughter cells that each have a complete copy of the genome. Meiosis poses a special problem in which homologous chromosomes must first pair and then separate at the first meiotic division before sister chromatids separate at the second meiotic division. So, chromosome interactions between homologues are a unique feature of meiosis and are essential for proper chromosome segregation. Pairing and locking together of homologous chromosomes involves recombination interactions in some cases, but not in others. Although all organisms must match and lock homologous chromosomes to maintain genome integrity throughout meiosis, recent results indicate that the underlying mechanisms vary in different organisms.},

What renders 2\% of the mammalian genomes permissive to meiotic recombination by allowing Spo11 endonuclease to initiate double-strand breaks is largely unknown.

Here, we define nucleosome profiles and dynamics at four mouse recombination hotspots by purifying highly enriched fractions of meiotic cells. We found that nucleosome occupancy is generally stable during meiosis progression. Interestingly, the cores of recombination hotspots have largely open chromatin structure, and the localization of the few nucleosomes present in these cores correlates precisely with the crossover-free zones in recombinogenic domains. Collectively, these high-resolution studies suggest that nucleosome occupancy seems to direct, at least in part, how meiotic recombination events are processed.},

  abstract = {In most species, crossovers (COs) are essential for the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes at the first meiotic division. Their number and location are tightly regulated. Here, we report a detailed, genome-wide characterization of the rate and localization of COs in Arabidopsis thaliana, in male and female meiosis. We observed dramatic differences between male and female meiosis which included: (i) genetic map length; 575 cM versus 332 cM respectively; (ii) CO distribution patterns: male CO rates were very high at both ends of each chromosome, whereas female CO rates were very low; (iii) correlations between CO rates and various chromosome features: female CO rates correlated strongly and negatively with GC content and gene density but positively with transposable elements (TEs) density, whereas male CO rates correlated positively with the CpG ratio. However, except for CpG, the correlations could be explained by the unequal repartition of these sequences along the Arabidopsis chromosome. For both male and female meiosis, the number of COs per chromosome correlates with chromosome size expressed either in base pairs or as synaptonemal complex length. Finally, we show that interference modulates the CO distribution both in male and female meiosis., Reciprocal exchanges of genetic material (crossovers) between homologous chromosomes ensure their proper segregation to generate gametes. Their number and location along chromosomes are tightly regulated. We localized precisely the position of 13,535 crossovers in more than 3,000 plants of Arabidopsis thaliana. While A. thaliana is a hermaphrodite plant with male and female meiosis occurring in the same flower and thus with the same genome, we observed dramatic differences in the distribution and the rate of crossovers along chromosomes in male and female meiosis. On average, chromosomes recombine 1.7 times more in male than in female meiosis. Moreover, male CO rates are very high at both ends of each chromosome, whereas female CO rates are very low. Finally, for the first time in a eukaryote, we show that the correlations between CO rates and various chromosome features differ in male and female meiosis. Female CO rates correlated strongly and negatively with GC content and gene density but positively with transposable elements density, whereas male CO rates correlated positively with the CpG ratio. However, most of the correlations could be explained by the structure of the Arabidopsis genome.},

It is assumed that the population consists of N diploid, randomly mating individuals, that each of the two loci mutate according to the infinite allele model at a rate \textmu{} and that the population is at equilibrium. When 4N\textmu{} is small, the most probable samples of gametes are those that segregate only two alleles at either locus. The probabilities of various samples of gametes are discussed. The results show that most samples with completely linked loci have either a very small or a very large association between the alleles of each locus. This causes the distribution of linkage disequilibrium to be skewed and the distribution of the correlation coefficient to be bimodal. The correlation coefficient is commonly used as a test statistic with a chi square distribution and yet has a bimodal distribution when the loci are completely linked. Thus, such a test is not likely to be accurate unless the rate of recombination between the loci and/or the effective population size are sufficiently large enough so that the loci can be treated as unlinked.},

Within species, Prdm9 determines the sites of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and meiotic recombination hotspots. To investigate the relation between Prdm9-controlled meiotic arrest and asynapsis, we inserted random stretches of consubspecific homology on several autosomal pairs in sterile hybrids, and analyzed their ability to form synaptonemal complexes and to rescue male fertility. Twenty-seven or more megabases of consubspecific (belonging to the same subspecies) homology fully restored synapsis in a given autosomal pair, and we predicted that two or more DSBs within symmetric hotspots per chromosome are necessary for successful meiosis. We hypothesize that impaired recombination between evolutionarily diverged chromosomes could function as one of the mechanisms of hybrid sterility occurring in various sexually reproducing species.},

Hotspots are predicted to be preferred sites for the initiation of meiotic recombination and their positions and activities are regulated by yet-unknown controls. The activity of the Psmb9 hotspot on mouse Chromosome 17 (Chr 17) varies according to genetic background. It is active in strains carrying a recombinant Chr 17 where the proximal third is derived from Mus musculus molossinus. We have identified the genetic locus required for Psmb9 activity, named Dsbc1 for Double-strand break control 1, and mapped this locus within a 6.7-Mb region on Chr 17. Based on cytological analysis of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and crossovers (COs), we show that Dsbc1 influences DSB and CO, not only at Psmb9, but in several other regions of Chr 17. We further show that CO distribution is also influenced by Dsbc1 on Chrs 15 and 18. Finally, we provide direct molecular evidence for the regulation in trans mediated by Dsbc1, by showing that it controls the CO activity at the Hlx1 hotspot on Chr 1. We thus propose that Dsbc1 encodes for a trans-acting factor involved in the specification of initiation sites of meiotic recombination genome wide in mice.},

In many eukaryotes, sites of meiotic recombination, also called hotspots, are regions of accessible chromatin, but in many vertebrates, their location follows a distinct pattern and is specified by PR domain-containing protein 9 (PRDM9). The specification of meiotic recombination hotspots is achieved by the different activities of PRDM9: DNA binding, histone methyltransferase, and interaction with other proteins. Remarkably, PRDM9 activity leads to the erosion of its own binding sites and the rapid evolution of its DNA-binding domain. PRDM9 may also contribute to reproductive isolation, as it is involved in hybrid sterility potentially due to a reduction of its activity in specific heterozygous contexts.},

The aim of this study was to characterize sequence variation at the PRDM9 locus in a sample of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees and bonobos.

Methodology/Principal Findings
PRDM9 contains a highly variable and repetitive zinc finger array. We amplified this domain using long-range PCR and determined the DNA sequences using conventional Sanger sequencing. From 17 chimpanzees representing three subspecies and five bonobos we obtained a total of 12 alleles differing at the nucleotide level. Based on a data set consisting of our data and recently published Pan PRDM9 sequences, we found that at the subspecies level, diversity levels did not differ among chimpanzee subspecies or between chimpanzee subspecies and bonobos. In contrast, the sample of chimpanzees harbors significantly more diversity at PRDM9 than samples of humans. Pan PRDM9 shows signs of rapid evolution including no alleles or ZnFs in common with humans as well as signals of positive selection in the residues responsible for DNA binding.

Conclusions and Significance
The high number of alleles specific to the genus Pan, signs of positive selection in the DNA binding residues, and reported lack of conservation of recombination hotspots between chimpanzees and humans suggest that PRDM9 could be active in hotspot recruitment in the genus Pan. Chimpanzees and bonobos are considered separate species and do not have overlapping ranges in the wild, making the presence of shared alleles at the amino acid level between the chimpanzee and bonobo species interesting in view of the hypothesis that PRDM9 plays a universal role in interspecific hybrid sterility.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is sexually dimorphic in most mammalian species, including humans, but the basis for the male:female differences remains unclear. In the present study, we used cytological methodology to directly compare recombination levels between human males and females, and to examine possible sex-specific differences in upstream events of double-strand break (DSB) formation and synaptic initiation. Specifically, we utilized the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1 as a marker of recombination events, the RecA homologue RAD51 as a surrogate for DSBs, and the synaptonemal complex proteins SYCP3 and/or SYCP1 to examine synapsis between homologs. Consistent with linkage studies, genome-wide recombination levels were higher in females than in males, and the placement of exchanges varied between the sexes. Subsequent analyses of DSBs and synaptic initiation sites indicated similar male:female differences, providing strong evidence that sex-specific differences in recombination rates are established at or before the formation of meiotic DSBs. We then asked whether these differences might be linked to variation in the organization of the meiotic axis and/or axis-associated DNA and, indeed, we observed striking male:female differences in synaptonemal complex (SC) length and DNA loop size. Taken together, our observations suggest that sex specific differences in recombination in humans may derive from chromatin differences established prior to the onset of the recombination pathway.},

We then used this strategy to carry out the first temporal analysis of meiotic recombination in mouse spermatogenesis and demonstrate that crossover events occur during the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase.},

Genetic recombination is an essential process in generating genetic diversity. Recombination occurs both through the shuffling of maternal and paternal chromosomes and through mutations generated by resolution of the physical breaks necessary for this process. Halldorsson et al. sequenced the full genomes of parents and offspring to create a map of human recombination and estimate the relationship with de novo mutations. Interestingly, transcribed regions of the genome were less likely to have crossovers, suggesting that there may be selection to reduce changes in genetic sequences via recombination or mutation in these regions.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONDiversity in the sequence of the human genome, arising from recombinations and mutations, is fundamental to human evolution and human diversity. Meiotic recombination is initiated from double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs occur more frequently in regions of the genome termed hotspots, and a small subset eventually gives rise to crossovers, a reciprocal exchange of large pieces between homologous chromosomes. The majority of DSBs do not lead to crossovers but end as localized transfers of short segments between homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids, observable as gene conversions when the segment includes a heterozygous marker. Crossovers co-occurring with distal gene conversions are known as complex crossovers.
RATIONALECurrent meiotic recombination maps either have limited resolution or the events cannot be resolved to an individual level. The detection of recombination and de novo mutations (DNMs) requires genetic data on a proband and its parents, and a fine resolution of these events is possible only with whole-genome sequence data. Whole-genome sequencing and DNA microarray data allowed us to identify crossovers and DNMs in families at a high resolution. We resolved crossovers at an individual level, allowing us to examine variation in crossover patterns between individuals, analyzing which crossovers are complex and how crossover patterns are influenced by age, sex, sequence variants, and epigenomic factors. It is known that the mutation rate is increased near crossovers, but the rate of DNMs near crossovers has been characterized only indirectly or at a small scale.
RESULTSWe show that a number of epigenomic factors influence crossover location, shifting crossovers from exons to enhancers. Complex crossovers are more common in females than males, and the rate of complex crossovers increases with maternal age. Maternal age also correlates with an increase in the recombination rate in general and a shift in the location of crossovers toward later-replicating regions and regions of lower GC content. Both sexes show an \textasciitilde{}50-fold increase in DNMs within 1 kb of crossovers, but the types of DNMs differ considerably between the sexes. Females, but not males, also exhibit an increase in the mutation rate up to 40 kb from crossovers, particularly at complex crossovers. We found 47 variants at 35 loci affecting the recombination rate and/or the location of crossover, 24 of which are coding or splice region variants. Whereas some of the variants affect both the recombination rate and several measures of crossover location in both sexes, other variants affect only one of these measures in one of the sexes. Many of these variants are in genes that encode the synaptonemal complex.
CONCLUSIONOur genome-wide recombination map provides a resolution of 682 base pairs. We show that crossovers have a direct mutagenic effect and demonstrate that DNMs and crossovers accumulate in the same regions with advancing maternal age. Furthermore, our results illustrate extensive genetic control of meiotic recombinations and highlight genes linked to the formation of the synaptonemal complex as determinants of crossovers. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/363/6425/eaau1043/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Our search for crossovers in parents and their offspring.Histone modifications influence crossover location. The DNM rate is higher within 1 kb from a crossover in both sexes, but the type of mutations differs between the sexes. The DNM rate is also higher up to 40 kb from crossovers in females with enrichment of G\textrightarrow{}C mutations. We used crossovers from many individuals to construct genetic maps and performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the recombination rate and attributes of crossover locations to search for genes that control crossover characteristics.
Genetic diversity arises from recombination and de novo mutation (DNM). Using a combination of microarray genotype and whole-genome sequence data on parent-child pairs, we identified 4,531,535 crossover recombinations and 200,435 DNMs. The resulting genetic map has a resolution of 682 base pairs. Crossovers exhibit a mutagenic effect, with overrepresentation of DNMs within 1 kilobase of crossovers in males and females. In females, a higher mutation rate is observed up to 40 kilobases from crossovers, particularly for complex crossovers, which increase with maternal age. We identified 35 loci associated with the recombination rate or the location of crossovers, demonstrating extensive genetic control of meiotic recombination, and our results highlight genes linked to the formation of the synaptonemal complex as determinants of crossovers.

This sequence was found in all eukaryotic genomes examined from yeast to human, indicating extraordinary evolutionary conservation. The number of the sequence ranged from about 100 in yeast to tens of thousands in higher eukaryotes. Comparison of nucleotide sequences of dT-dG alternating regions and its flanking regions in several cloned genes showed that the repeated element [the Z(T-G) element]] consists only of dT-dG alternating sequence with variable length. The presence of another purine-pyrimidine alternating sequence was also surveyed in eukaryotic genomes by Southern blot hybridization using 32P-labeled poly(dG-dC) . poly(dG-dC) as the probe. The stretches of dC-dG alternating sequence [the Z(C-G) element] were found to be moderately repetitive in human, mouse, and salmon genomes. However, a few and no copies of the Z(C-G) element were found in yeast and calf genomes, respectively. These results provide evidence for the abundance of potential Z-DNA-forming sequences in nature.},

The interconversion of sequences between B and Z forms, under the influence, for example, of DNA binding proteins or chemical modification, may be important in regulating DNA function. So far, little data have been published on the occurrence of potential Z-DNA forming sequences in eukaryotic DNA. Here we report the presence of a sequence of 50 alternating dT and dG residues within one of the introns of a human cardiac muscle actin gene.

The first mutation event interrupts the reading frame and function while the second compensates both. The fixation of this allele variant in tarsiers led to hypothesize that de- and reactivation of the zinc finger domain drove the speciation in early haplorhine or tarsiiform primates. Moreover, the high allelic diversity within Tarsius points to multiple effects of genetic drift reflecting their phylogeographic history since the Miocene.},

In the past five years, the increasing availability of large-scale population genetic data on dense sets of markers, coupled with advances in statistical methods for extracting information from these data, have led to several important advances in our understanding of the recombination process in humans. These advances include the identification of large numbers of `hotspots', where recombination appears to take place considerably more frequently than in the surrounding sequence, and the identification of DNA sequence motifs that are associated with the locations of these hotspots.},

This uncoupling of variation within and between species has been widely interpreted as evidence that natural selection shapes patterns of genetic variability genomewide. We revisited the relationship between diversity, divergence, and recombination in humans, using data from closely related species and better estimates of recombination rates than previously available. We show that regions that experience less recombination have reduced divergence to chimpanzee and to baboon, as well as lower levels of diversity. This observation suggests that mutation and recombination are associated processes in humans, so that the positive correlation between diversity and recombination may have a purely neutral explanation. Consistent with this hypothesis, diversity levels no longer increase significantly with recombination rates after correction for divergence to chimpanzee.},

Pertinent to the question of the relative importance of these two forces is the observation that both diversity within species and interspecies divergence increase with recombination rates. This suggests that mutation and recombination are either directly coupled or linked through some third factor. Here, we test these possibilities using the recently generated sequence of the chimpanzee genome and new estimates of human diversity. We find that measures of GC and CpG content, simple-repeat structures, as well as the distance from the centromeres and the telomeres predict diversity as well as divergence. After controlling for these factors, large-scale recombination rates measured from pedigrees are still significant predictors of human diversity and human-chimpanzee divergence. Furthermore, the correlation between human diversity and recombination remains significant even after controlling for human-chimpanzee divergence. Two plausible and non-mutually exclusive explanations are, first, that natural selection has shaped the patterns of diversity seen in humans and, second, that recombination rates across the genome have changed since humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor, so that current recombination rates are a better predictor of diversity than of divergence. Because there are indications that recombination rates may have changed rapidly during human evolution, we favor the latter explanation.},

To investigate the detailed recombination pattern in a flowering plant, we use shotgun resequencing of a wild population of the monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus to precisely locate over 400,000 boundaries of historic crossovers or gene conversion tracts. Their distribution defines some 13,000 hotspots of varying strengths, interspersed with cold regions of undetectably low recombination. Average recombination rates peak near starts of genes and fall off sharply, exhibiting polarity. Within genes, recombination tracts are more likely to terminate in exons than in introns. The general pattern is similar to that observed in yeast, as well as in positive-regulatory domain zinc finger protein 9-knockout mice, suggesting that recombination initiation described here in Mimulus may reflect ancient and conserved eukaryotic mechanisms.},

Two situations were studied: (i) where both loci had no effect on fitness and (ii) where they showed heterozygote superiority, but no epistacy.If the populations are initially in linkage equilibrium, then the mean value ofD remains zero with inbreeding, but the mean ofD2 increases to a maximum value and decreases until fixation is reached at both loci. The tighter the linkage and the greater the selection, then the later is the maximum in the mean ofD2 reached, and the larger its value. The correlation of gene frequencies,r, in the population of gametes within segregating lines was also studied. It was found that, for a range of selection intensities and initial gene frequencies, the mean value ofr2 was determined almost entirely byN c and time, measured proportional toN.The implication of these results on observations of linkage disequilibrium in natural populations is discussed.},

Most eukaryotes rely on crossing over between homologs, and the resulting chiasmata, to direct meiosis I chromosome segregation, yet make very few crossovers per chromosome pair. This indicates that meiotic recombination must be tightly regulated to ensure that each chromosome pair enjoys the crossover necessary to ensure correct segregation. Here, we investigate control of meiotic crossing over in Caenorhabditis elegans, which averages only one crossover per chromosome pair per meiosis, by constructing genetic maps of end-to-end fusions of whole chromosomes. Fusion of chromosomes removes the requirement for a crossover in each component chromosome segment and thereby reveals a propensity to restrict the number of crossovers such that pairs of fusion chromosomes composed of two or even three whole chromosomes enjoy but a single crossover in the majority of meioses. This regulation can operate over physical distances encompassing half the genome. The meiotic behavior of heterozygous fusion chromosomes further suggests that continuous meiotic chromosome axes, or structures that depend on properly assembled axes, may be important for crossover regulation.},

Here we leverage the recent mixture of people of African and European ancestry in the Americas to build a genetic map measuring the probability of crossing over at each position in the genome, based on about 2.1 million crossovers in 30,000 unrelated African Americans. At intervals of more than three megabases it is nearly identical to a map built in Europeans. At finer scales it differs significantly, and we identify about 2,500 recombination hotspots that are active in people of West African ancestry but nearly inactive in Europeans. The probability of a crossover at these hotspots is almost fully controlled by the alleles an individual carries at PRDM9 (P value {$<$} 10-245). We identify a 17-base-pair DNA sequence motif that is enriched in these hotspots, and is an excellent match to the predicted binding target of PRDM9 alleles common in West Africans and rare in Europeans. Sites of this motif are predicted to be risk loci for disease-causing genomic rearrangements in individuals carrying these alleles. More generally, this map provides a resource for research in human genetic variation and evolution.},

This allowed us to produce a high-resolution description of the global pattern of genetic variation. We applied three complementary selection tests and identified new targets of selection. Further, we characterized the pattern of historical recombination in A. thaliana and observed an enrichment of hotspots in its intergenic regions and repetitive DNA, which is consistent with the pattern that is observed for humans but which is strikingly different from that observed in other plant species.

Formulas are derived for the mean and variance of R. In contrast to R, RM can be determined from the sample. Since no formulas are known for the mean and variance of RM, they are estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that RM is often much less than R, therefore, the number of recombination events may be greatly under-estimated in a parsimonious reconstruction of the history of a sample. The statistic RM can be used to estimate the product of the recombination rate and the population size or, if the recombination rate is known, to estimate the population size. To illustrate this, DNA sequences from the Adh region of Drosophila melanogaster are used to estimate the effective population size of this species.},

This role involves its DNA-binding domain, which is composed of a tandem array of zinc fingers, and PRDM9-dependent trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4. PRDM9 is a member of the PRDM family of transcription regulators, but unlike other family members, it contains a Kr{\"u}ppel-associated box (KRAB)-related domain that is predicted to be a potential protein interaction domain. Here, we show that truncation of the KRAB domain of mouse PRDM9 leads to loss of PRDM9 function and altered meiotic prophase and gametogenesis. In addition, we identified proteins that interact with the KRAB domain of PRDM9 in yeast two-hybrid assay screens, particularly CXXC1, a member of the COMPASS complex. We also show that CXXC1 interacts with IHO1, an essential component of the meiotic double-strand break (DSB) machinery. As CXXC1 is orthologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spp1 that links DSB sites to the DSB machinery on the chromosome axis, we propose that these molecular interactions involved in the regulation of meiotic DSB formation are conserved in mouse meiosis.},

  abstract = {Recent findings established a link between DNA sequence composition and interphase chromatin architecture and explained the evolutionary conservation of TADs (Topologically Associated Domains) and LADs (Lamina Associated Domains) in mammals. This prompted us to analyse conformation capture and recombination rate data to study the relationship between chromatin architecture and recombination landscape of human and mouse genomes. The results reveal that: (1) low recombination domains and blocks of elevated linkage disequilibrium tend to coincide with TADs and isochores, indicating co-evolving regulatory elements and genes in insulated neighbourhoods; (2) double strand break (DSB) and recombination frequencies increase in the short loops of GC-rich TADs, whereas recombination cold spots are typical of LADs and (3) the binding and loading of proteins, which are critical for DSB and meiotic recombination (SPO11, DMC1, H3K4me3 and PRMD9) are higher in GC-rich TADs. One explanation for these observations is that the occurrence of DSB and recombination in meiotic cells are associated with compositional and epigenetic features (genomic code) that influence DNA stiffness/flexibility and appear to be similar to those guiding the chromatin architecture in the interphase nucleus of pre-leptotene cells.},

Allele-specific cosuppression of crossovers and repeat instability suggests that the hotspot is responsible for driving repeat turnover at MS32 and thus that minisatellites might evolve as by-products of localized meiotic recombination in the human genome.},

The relative influences of meiotic crossover distribution and population history on LD remain unclear, however. In particular, it is uncertain to what extent crossovers are clustered into 'hot spots, that might influence LD patterns. As a first step to investigating the relationship between LD and recombination, we have analyzed a 216-kb segment of the class II region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) already characterized for familial crossovers. High-resolution LD analysis shows the existence of extended domains of strong association interrupted by patchwork areas of LD breakdown. Sperm typing shows that these areas correspond precisely to meiotic crossover hot spots. All six hot spots defined share a remarkably similar symmetrical morphology but vary considerably in intensity, and are not obviously associated with any primary DNA sequence determinants of hot-spot activity. These hot spots occur in clusters and together account for almost all crossovers in this region of the MHC. These data show that, within the MHC at least, crossovers are far from randomly distributed at the molecular level and that recombination hot spots can profoundly affect LD patterns.},

Reciprocal crossover generates recombinant haplotypes but should not influence the frequencies of alleles in a population. We demonstrate crossover asymmetry at a recombination hot spot in the major histocompatibility complex, whereby reciprocal exchanges in sperm map to different locations in the hot spot. We identify a single-nucleotide polymorphism at the center of the hot spot and show that, when heterozygous, it seems sufficient to cause this asymmetry, apparently by influencing the efficiency of highly localized crossover initiation. As a consequence, crossovers in heterozygotes are accompanied by biased gene conversion, most likely occurring by gap repair, that can also affect nearby polymorphisms through repair of an extended gap. The result is substantial over-transmission of the recombination-suppressing allele and neighboring markers to crossover products. Computer simulations show that this meiotic drive, although weak at the population level, is sufficient to favor eventual fixation of the recombination-suppressing variant. These findings provide an explanation for the relatively uniform widths of human crossover hot spots and suggest that hot spots may be generally prone to extinction by meiotic drive.},

We therefore developed screening and selection methods to characterize sperm conversions in two meiotic crossover hot spots in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)8 and one in the sex chromosomal pseudoautosomal pairing region PAR1 (ref. 9). All three hot spots are active in gene conversion and crossover. Conversion tracts are short and define a steep bidirectional gradient centered at the peak of crossover activity, consistent with crossovers and conversions being produced by the same recombination-initiating events. These initiations seem to be spread over a narrow zone, rather than occurring at a single site, and seem preferentially to yield conversions rather than crossovers. Crossover breakpoints are more broadly diffused than conversion breakpoints, suggesting either differences between conversion and crossover processing after initiation or the existence of a quality control checkpoint at which short interactions between homologous chromosomes are preferentially aborted as conversions.},

We now describe the detailed analysis of sperm recombination in the NID1 hotspot. Like the neighbouring MS32 hotspot, the NID1 hotspot is associated with a minisatellite, suggesting that hotspots predispose DNA to tandem repetition. Unlike MS32, crossover resolution breakpoints in NID1 avoid the minisatellite, producing a cold spot within the hotspot. This avoidance may be related to the palindromic nature of the minisatellite interfering with the generation and/or processing of recombination intermediates. The NID1 hotspot also contains a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) close to the centre, which appears to directly influence the frequency of crossover initiation. Quantitative gene conversion assays show that this SNP affects the frequency of gene conversion and crossover to a very similar extent, providing evidence that conversions and crossovers are triggered by the same recombination initiating events. The recombination-suppressing allele is over-transmitted to recombinant progeny, and provides the most dramatic example to date of recombination-mediated meiotic drive, of a magnitude sufficient to virtually guarantee that the recombination suppressor will eventually replace the more active allele in human populations.},

But our direct understanding of hot-spot properties and distributions is largely limited to sperm typing in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)7. We now describe the analysis of an unremarkable 206-kb region on human chromosome 1, which identified localized regions of linkage disequilibrium breakdown that mark the locations of sperm crossover hot spots. The distribution, intensity and morphology of these hot spots are markedly similar to those in the MHC. But we also accidentally detected additional hot spots in regions of strong association. Coalescent analysis of genotype data detected most of the hot spots but showed significant differences between sperm crossover frequencies and historical recombination rates. This raises the possibility that some hot spots, particularly those in regions of strong association, may have evolved very recently and not left their full imprint on haplotype diversity. These results suggest that hot spots could be very abundant and possibly fluid features of the human genome.},

Hot spots also appear to be ephemeral- but processes of hot-spot activation and their subsequent evolutionary dynamics remain unknown. We now analyse the life cycle of a recombination hot spot. Sperm typing revealed a polymorphic hot spot that was activated in cis by a single base change, providing evidence for a primary sequence determinant necessary, though not sufficient, to activate recombination. This activating mutation occurred roughly 70,000 years ago and has persisted to the present, most likely fortuitously through genetic drift despite its systematic elimination by biased gene conversion. Nonetheless, this self-destructive conversion will eventually lead to hot-spot extinction. These findings define a subclass of highly transient hot spots and highlight the importance of understanding hot-spot turnover and how it influences haplotype diversity.},

We now explore germ-line instability of this domain in humans. We show that repeat turnover is driven by mitotic and meiotic mutation pathways, the latter frequently resulting in substantial remodeling of zinc fingers. Turnover dynamics predict frequent allele switches in populations with correspondingly fast changes of the recombination landscape, fully consistent with the known rapid evolution of hotspot locations. We found variation in meiotic instability between men that correlated with PRDM9 status. One particular ``destabilizer'' variant caused hyperinstability not only of itself but also of otherwise-stable alleles in heterozygotes. PRDM9 protein thus appears to regulate the instability of its own coding sequence. However, destabilizer variants are strongly self-limiting in populations and probably have little impact on the evolution of the recombination landscape.},

Humans have greater overall levels of recombination, as well as greater variance. In rat and mouse, the size of the chromosome and proximity to telomere have less effect on local recombination rate than in human. At the chromosome level, rat and mouse X chromosomes have the lowest recombination rates, whereas human chromosome X does not show the same pattern. In all species, local recombination rate is significantly correlated with several sequence variables, including GC\%, CpG density, repetitive elements, and the neutral mutation rate, with some pronounced differences between species. Recombination rate in one species is not strongly correlated with the rate in another, when comparing homologous syntenic blocks of the genome.

The analyses show that the pattern of chiasma distribution in the abnormal genotype conforms to the statistical expectations of randomness, and this is interpreted as being due to a breakdown of the processes which govern the distribution of chiasmata in normal rye genotypes. On the basis of these findings it is proposed that two independent and fundamentally different control systems are involved in the maintenance of efficient chiasma conditions in rye. One of these controls simply gives competence for chiasma formation, the other control system is evidently concerned with regulating the distribution of chiasmata. Analysis of two trisomic genotypes reveals that the conclusions relating to large samples of bivalents are also applicable to particular identifiable chromosomes. The results of brceding tests involving the two contrasting genotypes show that the control of chiasma distribution in rye has a complex genetic basis.},

Increasing between-bivalent mean squares in the rye genotypes studied are accompanied by increasing proportions of non-distal chiasmata.These correlations are considered in terms of one and two-component models of chiasma control.

  abstract = {The question of recombination control has been the subject of intensive investigation over many years. This paper is restricted to an evaluation of the information obtainable from cytological studies of chiasmata, since other approaches are well represented in other papers in this volume. The advantages and disadvantages of chiasmata as means of studying recombination are discussed. Cytological observations reveal many constraints on the distribution of chiasmata, which are interpreted as outward expressions of controls operating at different levels, namely between cells, between bivalents and within bivalents. Detailed descriptions of these constraints are presented as a preliminary to discussing models and mechanisms of control. They include, at the between-bivalent level, over-dispersal of chiasma number per bivalent and the formation of an obligatory minimum of one chiasma per bivalent; and at the within-bivalent level, chiasma localization and chiasma interference. The genetical basis of these constraints is emphasized and evidence presented which suggests that chiasma distribution at different levels is subject to both separate and coordinate genetical controls. These observations lead to the consideration and evaluation of general stochastic models of chiasma control based on the modification of site probabilities for chiasma formation. While these models are a useful approach to thinking about the control of recombination, they do not give a fully satisfactory explanation of all aspects of chiasma control. Finally, specific mechanisms for chiasma distribution control are considered. In a few exceptional species, localized pairing and synaptonemal complexes lead to localized chiasma formation; details of two such cases are presented. In the majority of species, pairing is not localized or restricted and in these species the control of chiasma distribution is more conjectural. Arguments are presented which suggest that even in these cases of full pairing, the pattern of pairing initiation and progression and perhaps the timing of these events could be important factors controlling the distribution of chiasmata.},

Crossover assurance ensures at least one crossover per homolog pair, while interference reduces double crossovers. Here, we have investigated the interplay between chromosome axis morphogenesis and non-random crossover placement. We demonstrate that chromosome axes are structurally modified at future crossover sites as indicated by correspondence between crossover designation marker Zip3 and domains enriched for axis ensemble Hop1/Red1. This association is first detected at the zygotene stage, persists until double Holliday junction resolution, and is controlled by the conserved AAA+ ATPase Pch2. Pch2 further mediates crossover interference, although it is dispensable for crossover formation at normal levels. Thus, interference appears to be superimposed on underlying mechanisms of crossover formation. When recombination-initiating DSBs are reduced, Pch2 is also required for viable spore formation, consistent with further functions in chiasma formation. pch2Delta mutant defects in crossover interference and spore viability at reduced DSB levels are oppositely modulated by temperature, suggesting contributions of two separable pathways to crossover control. Roles of Pch2 in controlling both chromosome axis morphogenesis and crossover placement suggest linkage between these processes. Pch2 is proposed to reorganize chromosome axes into a tiling array of long-range crossover control modules, resulting in chiasma formation at minimum levels and with maximum spacing.},

The map contains 627 new markers and 623 previously linked markers, providing a basis for integrating the four published bovine maps. Orientation and chromosomal assignment of all the linkage groups, except BTA20 and BTA22, was provided by 88 markers that were assigned previously to chromosomes.

Crossovers at this hot spot are not obviously affected by a large insertion/deletion polymorphism near the hot spot. The second region of LD breakdown, within the DPB1 gene, shows an extremely low level of sperm crossover activity and does not contain a sperm crossover hot spot.

Thus far, no method has existed for pinpointing sites of crossing-over on a genome-wide scale in an experimentally tractable animal whose genome size and complexity models that of humans. Here, we present a genomic approach to identify mouse crossover hotspots, based on targeting haplotype block boundaries. This represents a previously undescribed method potentially applicable to large-scale mouse hotspot identification. Using this method, we have successfully predicted the location of two previously uncharacterized crossover hotspots in male mice. As increasing amounts of single-nucleotide polymorphism data emerge, this approach will be useful for investigating the recombination landscape of the mouse genome.},

  abstract = {Crossovers play mechanical roles in meiotic chromosome segregation, generate genetic diversity by producing new allelic combinations, and facilitate evolution by decoupling linked alleles. In almost every species studied to date, crossover distributions are dramatically nonuniform, differing among sexes and across genomes, with spatial variation in crossover rates on scales from whole chromosomes to subkilobase hotspots. To understand the regulatory forces dictating these heterogeneous distributions a crucial first step is the fine-scale characterization of crossover distributions. Here we define the wild-type distribution of crossovers along a region of the C. elegans chromosome II at unprecedented resolution, using recombinant chromosomes of 243 hermaphrodites and 226 males. We find that well-characterized large-scale domains, with little fine-scale rate heterogeneity, dominate this region's crossover landscape. Using the Gini coefficient as a summary statistic, we find that this region of the C. elegans genome has the least heterogeneous fine-scale crossover distribution yet observed among model organisms, and we show by simulation that the data are incompatible with a mammalian-type hotspot-rich landscape. The large-scale structural domains\textemdash{}the low-recombination center and the high-recombination arm\textemdash{}have a discrete boundary that we localize to a small region. This boundary coincides with the arm-center boundary defined both by nuclear-envelope attachment of DNA in somatic cells and GC content, consistent with proposals that these features of chromosome organization may be mechanical causes and evolutionary consequences of crossover recombination.},

DSBs can be directly mapped using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). Nevertheless, the genome-wide mapping of recombination hotspots in mammals is still a challenge due to the low frequency of recombination, high heterogeneity of the germ cell population, and the relatively low efficiency of ChIP. To overcome these limitations we have developed a novel method--single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequencing (SSDS)--that specifically detects protein-bound single-stranded DNA at DSB ends. SSDS comprises a computational framework for the specific detection of ssDNA-derived reads in a sequencing library and a new library preparation procedure for the enrichment of fragments originating from ssDNA. The use of our technique reduces the nonspecific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) background {$>$}10-fold. Our method can be extended to other systems where the identification of ssDNA or DSBs is desired.},

LD decays within 10 kb on average, considerably faster than previously estimated. Tag SNP selection algorithms and 'hide-the-SNP' simulations suggest that genome-wide association mapping will require only 40\%-50\% of the observed SNPs, a reduction similar to estimates in a sample of African Americans. An Affymetrix genotyping array containing 250,000 SNPs has been designed based on these results; we demonstrate that it should have more than adequate coverage for genome-wide association mapping. The extent of LD is highly variable, and we find clear evidence of recombination hotspots, which seem to occur preferentially in intergenic regions. LD also reflects the action of selection, and it is more extensive between nonsynonymous polymorphisms than between synonymous polymorphisms.},

Through physical recombination analyses, we show that sister cohesion, normally mediated by meiotic cohesin Rec8, promotes "sister bias"; that meiosis-specific axis components Red1/Mek1kinase counteract this effect, thereby satisfying an essential precondition for homolog bias; and that other components, probably recombinosome-related, directly ensure homolog partner selection. Later, Rec8 acts positively to ensure maintenance of bias. These complexities mirror opposing dictates for global sister cohesion versus local separation and differentiation of sisters at recombination sites. Our findings support DSB formation within axis-tethered recombinosomes containing both sisters and ensuing programmed sequential release of "first" and "second" DSB ends. First-end release would create a homology-searching "tentacle." Rec8 and Red1/Mek1 also independently license recombinational progression and abundantly localize to different domains. These domains could comprise complementary environments that integrate inputs from DSB repair and mitotic chromosome morphogenesis into the complete meiotic program.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Although the etiology of human aneuploidy remains poorly understood, recent studies have elucidated certain fundamental correlates of meiotic nondisjunction, such as altered recombination. These features are extraordinarily similar to those associated with chromosome misbehavior in Drosophila melanogaster females. Furthermore, these organisms also share a significant level of achiasmate chromosome nondisjunction. Here we describe in detail the processes of achiasmate chromosome segregation in Drosophila and discuss how they may be most effectively applied to our understanding of the etiology of human aneuploidy. In particular, we examine the possibility that similar ``backup'' mechanisms of chromosome segregation might function in mammalian meiosis, particularly mammalian females. Drawing upon observations made in flies, we also propose a new model for the segregation of achiasmate chromosomes in humans.},

These frequencies ranged from a low of 21.5 exchanges in CAST/Ei to a high of 24.9 in SPRET/Ei. We also found that, as expected, these crossover events were nonrandomly distributed and displayed positive interference. However, we found no evidence for significant differences in the patterns of crossover positioning between strains with different exchange frequencies. From our observations of {$>$}10,000 autosomal synaptonemal complexes, we conclude that achiasmate bivalents arise in the male mouse at a frequency of 0.1\%.

PRDM9 automethylation is abolished by a single active-site mutation, C321P, also known to disrupt interactions with S-adenosylmethionine. We have taken an initial step towards tool compound generation through rational design of a substrate-mimic, peptidic inhibitor of PRDM9 automethylation. The discovery of automethylation in PRDM9 adds a new dimension to our understanding of PRDM9 enzymology.},

The formation of meiotic crossovers was previously posited to occur via two pathways, with the relative use of each pathway varying between organisms; however, this paradigm could not explain all crossovers, and many of the key proteins involved were unidentified. Recent studies that identify some of these proteins reinforce and expand the model of two meiotic crossover pathways. The results provide novel insights into the evolutionary origins of the pathways, suggesting that one is similar to a mitotic DNA repair pathway and the other evolved to incorporate special features unique to meiosis.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombinations contribute to genetic diversity by yielding new combinations of alleles. Recently, high-resolution recombination maps were inferred from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns that capture historical recombination events1,2. The use of these maps has been demonstrated by the identification of recombination hotspots2 and associated motifs3, and the discovery that the PRDM9 gene affects the proportion of recombinations occurring at hotspots4,5,6. However, these maps provide no information about individual or sex differences. Moreover, locus-specific demographic factors like natural selection7 can bias LD-based estimates of recombination rate. Existing genetic maps based on family data avoid these shortcomings8, but their resolution is limited by relatively few meioses and a low density of markers. Here we used genome-wide SNP data from 15,257 parent\textendash{}offspring pairs to construct the first recombination maps based on directly observed recombinations with a resolution that is effective down to 10 kilobases (kb). Comparing male and female maps reveals that about 15\% of hotspots in one sex are specific to that sex. Although male recombinations result in more shuffling of exons within genes, female recombinations generate more new combinations of nearby genes. We discover novel associations between recombination characteristics of individuals and variants in the PRDM9 gene and we identify new recombination hotspots. Comparisons of our maps with two LD-based maps inferred from data of HapMap populations of Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU) and Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) reveal population differences previously masked by noise and map differences at regions previously described as targets of natural selection.},

In many mammalian species, the Prdm9 gene is highly polymorphic. Prdm9 polymorphism is assumed to play two critical roles in evolution: to diversify the spectrum of meiotic recombination hotspots and to cause male hybrid sterility, leading to reproductive isolation and speciation. Nevertheless, information about Prdm9 sequences in natural populations is very limited. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive population survey on Prdm9 polymorphism in the house mouse, Mus musculus. Overall M. musculus Prdm9 displays an extraordinarily high level of polymorphism, particularly in regions encoding zinc finger repeats, which recognize recombination hotspots. Prdm9 alleles specific to various M. musculus subspecies dominate in subspecies territories. Moreover, introgression into other subspecies territories was found for highly divergent Prdm9 alleles associated with t-haplotype. The results of our phylogeographical analysis suggest that the requirement for hotspot diversity depends on geographical range and time span in mouse evolution, and that Prdm9 polymorphism has not been maintained by a simple balanced selection in the population of each subspecies.},

The meiotic cohesin Rec8 has been implicated in regulating DSB formation, but little is known about the features of their interplay. To elucidate this point, we investigated the genome-wide localization of Spo11 in budding yeast during early meiosis by chromatin immunoprecipitation using high-density tiling arrays. We found that Spo11 is dynamically localized to meiotic chromosomes. Spo11 initially accumulated around centromeres and thereafter localized to arm regions as premeiotic S phase proceeded. During this stage, a substantial proportion of Spo11 bound to Rec8 binding sites. Eventually, some of Spo11 further bound to both DSB and Rec8 sites. We also showed that such a change in a distribution of Spo11 is affected by hydroxyurea treatment. Interestingly, deletion of REC8 influences the localization of Spo11 to centromeres and in some of the intervals of the chromosomal arms. Thus, we observed a lack of DSB formation in a region-specific manner. These observations suggest that Rec8 would prearrange the distribution of Spo11 along chromosomes and will provide clues to understanding temporal and spatial regulation of DSB formation.},

  abstract = {In humans and many other species, recombination events cluster in narrow and short-lived hot spots distributed across the genome, whose location is determined by the Zn-finger protein PRDM9. To explain these fast evolutionary dynamics, an intra-genomic Red Queen model has been proposed, based on the interplay between two antagonistic forces: biased gene conversion, mediated by double-strand breaks, resulting in hot-spot extinction, followed by positive selection favouring new PRDM9 alleles recognizing new sequence motifs. Thus far, however, this Red Queen model has not been formalized as a quantitative population-genetic model, fully accounting for the intricate interplay between biased gene conversion, mutation, selection, demography and genetic diversity at the PRDM9 locus. Here, we explore the population genetics of the Red Queen model of recombination. A Wright\textendash{}Fisher simulator was implemented, allowing exploration of the behaviour of the model (mean equilibrium recombination rate, diversity at the PRDM9 locus or turnover rate) as a function of the parameters (effective population size, mutation and erosion rates). In a second step, analytical results based on self-consistent mean-field approximations were derived, reproducing the scaling relations observed in the simulations. Empirical fit of the model to current data from the mouse suggests both a high mutation rate at PRDM9 and strong biased gene conversion on its targets., This article is part of the themed issue `Evolutionary causes and consequences of recombination rate variation in sexual organisms'.},

Overall, mean cell chiasma frequencies of the two sexes did not differ significantly once the contribution of the presumptive X bivalent and the XY pair were taken into account. Sex related differences in chiasma distribution patterns were evident, however. In monochiasmate bivalents, the chiasma was most commonly located interstitially in oocytes while in spermatocytes it could be either interstitial or distal. In dichiasmate bivalents, the chiasmata tended to be more centrally located in oocytes than in spermatocytes. Minimum inter-chiasma distances did not appear to show any great variation in chromosome pairs of different sizes, however, mean inter-chiasma distances did increase with the bivalent length. The minimum-inter chiasma distance data suggest that chiasma interference is complete over a chromosomal segment equating to approximately 60 Mb. Measurement of the positions of chiasmata along chromosome arms open up the possibility of producing chiasma-based genetic maps for all the autosomes of the mouse.},

Some hypotheses have been put forward to explain this widespread phenomenon and, up to now, only one fact has emerged clearly: In species in which meiosis is achiasmate in one sex, it is the heterogametic one. This pattern, known as the Haldane-Huxley rule, is thought to be a side effect, on autosomes, of the suppression of recombination between the sex chromosomes. However, this rule does not hold for heterochiasmate species (i.e., species in which recombination is present in both sexes but varies quantitatively between sexes) and does not apply to species lacking sex chromosomes, such as hermaphroditic plants. In this paper, we show that in plants, heterochiasmy is due to a male-female difference in gametic selection and is not influenced by the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This finding provides strong empirical support in favour of a population genetic explanation for the evolution of heterochiasmy and, more broadly, for the evolution of sex and recombination.},

  abstract = {Recombination is an essential process in eukaryotes, which increases diversity by disrupting genetic linkage between loci and ensures the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. In the human genome, recombination events are clustered in hotspots, whose location is determined by the PRDM9 protein. There is evidence that the location of hotspots evolves rapidly, as a consequence of changes in PRDM9 DNA-binding domain. However, the reasons for these changes and the rate at which they occur are not known. In this study, we investigated the evolution of human hotspot loci and of PRDM9 target motifs, both in modern and archaic human lineages (Denisovan) to quantify the dynamic of hotspot turnover during the recent period of human evolution. We show that present-day human hotspots are young: they have been active only during the last 10\% of the time since the divergence from chimpanzee, starting to be operating shortly before the split between Denisovans and modern humans. Surprisingly, however, our analyses indicate that Denisovan recombination hotspots did not overlap with modern human ones, despite sharing similar PRDM9 target motifs. We further show that high-affinity PRDM9 target motifs are subject to a strong self-destructive drive, known as biased gene conversion (BGC), which should lead to the loss of the majority of them in the next 3 MYR. This depletion of PRDM9 genomic targets is expected to decrease fitness, and thereby to favor new PRDM9 alleles binding different motifs. Our refined estimates of the age and life expectancy of human hotspots provide empirical evidence in support of the Red Queen hypothesis of recombination hotspots evolution.},

The method is simple and very accurate with an efficiency close to 100\% for picking sperm cells and producing amplifiable DNA templates, circumventing the complicated statistical analysis mandated by automated cell sorting. The DNA was amplified in a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to achieve the necessary high specificity of amplification. In the first reaction, primers flanking the polymorphic site at each locus were used. The PCR product from the first reaction was then reamplified in a second PCR using primers that create allele-specific restriction sites (ACRS) in the PCR products for two of the three loci, allowing the alleles to be determined by gel electrophoresis. No recombinants were found among the 330 single sperm cells analyzed, giving a lod score higher than 30 and proving a very strong linkage between bovine casein genes.},

PCR analysis of 1,912 sperm was done with a manual, single-sperm isolation method. Data on four donors show highly significant linkage heterogeneity among individuals. The most significant difference was observed in a marker interval located in the middle of the Xp/Yp pseudoautosomal region, where one donor showed a particularly high recombination fraction. Longitudinal models were fitted to the data to test whether linkage heterogeneity among donors was significant for multiple intervals across the region. The results indicated that increased recombination in particular individuals and regions is compensated for by reduced recombination in neighboring intervals. To investigate correspondence between physical and genetic distances within the region, we constructed a high-resolution radiation-hybrid map containing 29 markers. The recombination fraction per unit of physical distance varies between regions ranging from 13- to 70-fold greater than the genome-average rate.},

  abstract = {SSX genes show extensive nucleotide sequence conservation but little is known of their function. Disruption of SSX1 or SSX2, by chromosome translocation and `in-frame' fusion to SYT, is a consistent feature of synovial sarcomas. The resulting SYT-SSX1/SSX2 proteins are activators of transcription; transactivation function is located in SYT. Unrearranged SSX1 can repress transcription, and this has been attributed to a putative Kr{\"u}ppel associated box (KRAB) repression domain at the N-terminus. Here we isolated SSX-KRAB domains to specifically measure repression activity, using a previously characterized KOX1-KRAB domain as a control. In our repressor assay SSX1- and SSX2-KRAB domains down-modulated the transactivation of a reporter gene by threefold, compared with 83-fold repression achieved by KOX1-KRAB in the assay. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that SSX1-KRAB, unlike KOX1-KRAB, fails to interact with the KRAB co-repressor TIF1{$\beta$}. These results raise questions about the evolutionary and functional relationship of SSX-KRAB and typical KRAB domains of Kr{\"u}ppel zinc finger genes. We found that full-length SSX1 showed potent (74-fold) repression in our repressor assay, indicating the existence of a repression domain distinct from SSX-KRAB. By assaying deletion constructs of SSX1 we localized repression activity to 33 amino acids at the C-terminus. This novel domain is conserved between SSX family members, and, unlike the KRAB-related domain, is retained on fusion with SYT. This has important implications in understanding the mechanism by which the SYT-SSX fusion protein could contribute to neoplasia.},

Five hundred and seventy-three of the loci can be ordered on a framework map with odds of {$>$} 1000 : 1. The sheep linkage map contains strong links to both the cattle and goat maps. Five hundred and seventy-two of the loci positioned on the sheep linkage map have also been mapped by linkage analysis in cattle, and 209 of the loci mapped on the sheep linkage map have also been placed on the goat linkage map. Inspection of ruminant linkage maps indicates that the genomic coverage by the current sheep linkage map is comparable to that of the available cattle maps.

Interference was seen between intervals when the distance in the region adjacent to a crossover was {$<$} approximately 35 cM (90 kb). At the met13 locus, which exhibits approximately 9\% gene conversions, those gene conversions accompanied by crossing over exerted interference in exchanges in an adjacent interval, whereas met13 gene conversions without an accompanying exchange did not show interference. The pattern of exchanges along this chromosome arm can be represented by a counting model in which there are three nonexchange events between adjacent exchanges; however, maximum-likelihood analysis suggests that approximately 8-12\% of the crossovers on chromosome VII arise by a separate, noninterfering mechanism.},

The methylation associated with DNA repeats in many eukaryotes might serve to inhibit homologous recombination and play a role in preserving genome integrity. We have tested the hypothesis that DNA methylation suppresses meiotic recombination in the fungus Ascobolus immersus. The natural process of methylation-induced premeiotically (MIP) was used to methylate the b2 spore color gene, a 7.5-kb chromosomal recombination hot spot. The frequency of crossing-over between two markers flanking b2 was reduced several hundredfold when b2 was methylated on the two homologs. This demonstrates that DNA methylation strongly inhibits homologous recombination. When b2 was methylated on one homolog only, crossing-over was still reduced 50-fold, indicating that the effect of methylation cannot be limited to the blocking of initiation of recombination on the methylated homolog. On the basis of these and other observations, we propose that DNA methylation perturbs pairing between the two intact homologs before recombination initiation and/or impairs the normal processing of recombination intermediates.},

The two recombination outcomes, crossover and non-crossover, increase genetic diversity, but have the potential to homogenize alleles by gene conversion. Whereas crossover rates vary considerably across the genome, non-crossovers and gene conversions have only been identified in a handful of loci. To examine recombination genome wide and at high spatial resolution, we generated maps of crossovers, crossover-associated gene conversion and non-crossover gene conversion using dense genetic marker data collected from all four products of fifty-six yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) meioses. Our maps reveal differences in the distributions of crossovers and non-crossovers, showing more regions where either crossovers or non-crossovers are favoured than expected by chance. Furthermore, we detect evidence for interference between crossovers and non-crossovers, a phenomenon previously only known to occur between crossovers. Up to 1\% of the genome of each meiotic product is subject to gene conversion in a single meiosis, with detectable bias towards GC nucleotides. To our knowledge the maps represent the first high-resolution, genome-wide characterization of the multiple outcomes of recombination in any organism. In addition, because non-crossover hotspots create holes of reduced linkage within haplotype blocks, our results stress the need to incorporate non-crossovers into genetic linkage analysis.},

Drosophila exhibit substantial recombination rate heterogeneity across their genome, but evidence for these highly-localized hotspots is lacking. We assayed recombination across a 40Kb region of Drosophila pseudoobscura chromosome 2, with one 20kb interval assayed every 5Kb and the adjacent 20kb interval bisected into 10kb pieces. We found that recombination events across the 40kb stretch were relatively evenly distributed across each of the 5kb and 10kb intervals, rather than concentrated in a single 5kb region. This, in combination with other recent work, indicates that the recombination landscape of Drosophila may differ from the punctate recombination pattern observed in many mammals and yeast. Additionally, we found no correlation of average pairwise nucleotide diversity and divergence with recombination rate across the 20kb intervals, nor any effect of maternal age in weeks on recombination rate in our sample.},

A 45-aa segment containing one of the predicted KRAB amphipathic helices was necessary and sufficient for repression.

Among many chromosomal features, GC content is one of the most prominent variables that appear to be highly correlated with recombination. However, it is not yet clear (1) whether recombination drives GC content (as proposed, for example, in the biased gene conversion model) or the converse and (2) what are the length scales for mutual influences between GC content and recombination. Here we have reassessed these questions for the model genome Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for which the most refined recombination data are available. First, we confirmed a strong correlation between recombination rate and GC content at local scales (a few kilobases). Second, on the basis of alignments between S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, and S. mikatae sequences, we showed that the inferred AT/GC substitution patterns are not correlated with recombination, indicating that GC content is not driven by recombination in yeast. These results thus suggest that, in S. cerevisiae, recombination is determined either by the GC content or by a third parameter, also affecting the GC content. Third, we observed long-range correlations between GC and recombination for chromosome III (for which such correlations were reported experimentally and were the model for many structural studies). However, similar correlations were not detected in the other chromosomes, restraining thus the generality of the phenomenon. These results pave the way for further analyses aimed at the detailed untangling of drives involved in the evolutionary shaping of the yeast genome.},

In total, 7,848 synaptonemal complexes from 436 spermatocytes were analyzed, and 13,969 recombination sites were mapped. Individual chromosomes for 113 of the 436 cells (representing 2,034 synaptonemal complexes) were identified by immunostaining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The average total length of autosomal synaptonemal complexes per cell was 190.3 \textmu{}m, with 32.0 recombination sites (crossovers), on average, per cell. The number of crossovers and the lengths of the autosomal synaptonemal complexes showed significant intra- (i.e. between cells) and inter-individual variations. The distributions of recombination sites within each chromosomal category were similar: crossovers in metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes were concentrated in the telomeric regions of the p- and q-arms, whereas two hotspots were located near the centromere and in the telomeric region of acrocentrics. Lack of MLH1 foci was mainly observed in the smaller chromosomes, particularly chromosome 18 (SSC18) and the sex chromosomes. All autosomes displayed positive interference, with a large variability between the chromosomes.},

  abstract = {An equine SNP genotyping array was developed and evaluated on a panel of samples representing 14 domestic horse breeds and 18 evolutionarily related species. More than 54,000 polymorphic SNPs provided an average inter-SNP spacing of {$\sim$}43 kb. The mean minor allele frequency across domestic horse breeds was 0.23, and the number of polymorphic SNPs within breeds ranged from 43,287 to 52,085. Genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) in most breeds declined rapidly over the first 50\textendash{}100 kb and reached background levels within 1\textendash{}2 Mb. The extent of LD and the level of inbreeding were highest in the Thoroughbred and lowest in the Mongolian and Quarter Horse. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses demonstrated the tight grouping of individuals within most breeds, close proximity of related breeds, and less tight grouping in admixed breeds. The close relationship between the Przewalski's Horse and the domestic horse was demonstrated by pair-wise genetic distance and MDS. Genotyping of other Perissodactyla (zebras, asses, tapirs, and rhinoceros) was variably successful, with call rates and the number of polymorphic loci varying across taxa. Parsimony analysis placed the modern horse as sister taxa to Equus przewalski. The utility of the SNP array in genome-wide association was confirmed by mapping the known recessive chestnut coat color locus (MC1R) and defining a conserved haplotype of {$\sim$}750 kb across all breeds. These results demonstrate the high quality of this SNP genotyping resource, its usefulness in diverse genome analyses of the horse, and potential use in related species.},

  abstract = {Mechanistic and regulatory aspects of meiotic chromosome pairing and segregation have received increasing attention in recent years. This review is concerned with the role of chromosomal sites and chromosome organization in pairing and sperm development in Drosophila. Two major topics are reviewed. The first concerns the distribution and identification of meiotic pairing sites in male Drosophila. Cytogenetic data show that pairing sites are distributed widely in the euchromatin of autosomes but are absent from centromeric heterochromatin. The reverse distribution holds for the X, where the major pairing site is located in the central region of the centric heterochromatin, co-mapping with the rDNA locus. Recent transgenic studies have demonstrated that this pairing site consists mainly of a 240-bp repeated sequence in the intergenic spacers of the rDNA repeats. These spacer repeats contain RNA polymerase I promoters, which must be functional for the repeats to have pairing activity, suggesting a mechanistic connection between pairing and transcription. The general idea that pairing sites coincide with transcribed sequences is discussed. The second major topic involves the effects of sex chromosome rearrangements on spermiogenesis. A variety of rearrangements involving the sex chromosomes, including heterochromatic deletions and translocations with autosomes, have been shown to lead either to meiotic drive or to sterility. Recent evidence strongly implicates the X chromosome pairing site in the etiology of these effects. These findings are discussed in terms of a novel model that interprets the spermiogenic disruptions associated with sex chromosome rearrangements as resulting from disabling of spermatids due to triggering of a checkpoint concerned with monitoring chromosome alignment at meiotic metaphase.},

The next challenge awaiting livestock geneticists is to determine the actual genes responsible for variation of economically important traits. With the advent of high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) maps, it may be possible to fine map genes by exploiting linkage disequilibrium between genes of interest and adjacent markers. However, the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) is generally unknown for livestock populations. In this article microsatellite genotype data are used to assess the extent of LD in two populations of domestic sheep. High levels of LD were found to extend for tens of centimorgans and declined as a function of marker distance. However, LD was also frequently observed between unlinked markers. The prospects for LD mapping in livestock appear encouraging provided that type I error can be minimized. Properties of the multiallelic LD coefficient D{${'}$} were also explored. D{${'}$} was found to be significantly related to marker heterozygosity, although the relationship did not appear to unduly influence the overall conclusions. Of potentially greater concern was the observation that D{${'}$} may be skewed when rare alleles are present. It is recommended that the statistical significance of LD is used in conjunction with coefficients such as D{${'}$} to determine the true extent of LD.},

We tested whether these differences reflect selection or are instead a byproduct of germline transcription, using publicly available gene expression data from a variety of germline and somatic tissues. Crossover rate shows a strong negative correlation with gene expression in meiotic tissues, suggesting that crossover is inhibited by transcription. Strand-biased composition (G+T content) and A \textrightarrow{} G versus T \textrightarrow{} C substitution asymmetry are both positively correlated with germline gene expression. We find no evidence for a strand bias in allele frequency data, implying that the substitution asymmetry reflects a mutation rather than a fixation bias. The density of transposable elements is positively correlated with germline expression, suggesting that such elements preferentially insert into regions that are actively transcribed. For each of the features examined, our analyses favor a nonselective explanation for the observed trends and point to the role of germline gene expression in shaping the mammalian genome.},

  abstract = {Using an antibody against the phosphorylated form of His2Av ({$\gamma$}-His2Av), we have described the time course for the series of events leading from the formation of a double-strand break (DSB) to a crossover in Drosophila female meiotic prophase. MEI-P22 is required for DSB formation and localizes to chromosomes prior to {$\gamma$}-His2Av foci. Drosophila females, however, are among the group of organisms where synaptonemal complex (SC) formation is not dependent on DSBs. In the absence of two SC proteins, C(3)G and C(2)M, the number of DSBs in oocytes is significantly reduced. This is consistent with the appearance of SC protein staining prior to {$\gamma$}-His2Av foci. However, SC formation is incomplete or absent in the neighboring nurse cells, and {$\gamma$}-His2Av foci appear with the same kinetics as in oocytes and do not depend on SC proteins. Thus, competence for DSB formation in nurse cells occurs with a specific timing that is independent of the SC, whereas in the oocytes, some SC proteins may have a regulatory role to counteract the effects of a negative regulator of DSB formation. The SC is not sufficient for DSB formation, however, since DSBs were absent from the heterochromatin even though SC formation occurs in these regions. All {$\gamma$}-His2Av foci disappear before the end of prophase, presumably as repair is completed and crossovers are formed. However, oocytes in early prophase exhibit a slower response to X-ray\textendash{}induced DSBs compared to those in the late pachytene stage. Assuming all DSBs appear as {$\gamma$}-His2Av foci, there is at least a 3:1 ratio of noncrossover to crossover products. From a comparison of the frequency of {$\gamma$}-His2Av foci and crossovers, it appears that Drosophila females have only a weak mechanism to ensure a crossover in the presence of a low number of DSBs., Meiosis is a specialized pair of cell divisions that creates haploid gametes by separating homologous chromosomes. Unlike most any other cell type, cells in meiotic prophase generate double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) that are repaired using the homolog as a template. While there are several DSBs per chromosome, usually only one is repaired as a crossover, which is when the two homologs have exchanged large segments of genetic information. Each crossover is important because it creates a linkage that holds the homologs together during the first meiotic division. To learn more about how the meiotic cell regulates the formation of crossovers, the authors performed a temporal analysis of the events from break formation through repair into a crossover in Drosophila females. These results indicate that timing is a critical factor in both the formation and repair of DSBs. DSB formation occurs only during the earliest stages of meiotic prophase and initiates at a specific time after premeiotic DNA replication. Surprisingly, the response to DSBs is slower in the middle of meiotic prophase than at later time points. It is only during this time, mid\textendash{}meiotic prophase, when the repair process is competent to produce crossovers.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is tightly regulated by cis- and trans-acting factors. Although DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling affect chromosome structure, their impact on meiotic recombination is not well understood. To study the effect of DNA methylation on the landscape of chromosomal recombination, we analyzed meiotic recombination in the decreased DNA methylation 1 (ddm1) mutant. DDM1 is a SWI2/SNF2-like chromatin-remodeling protein necessary for DNA methylation and heterochromatin maintenance in Arabidopsis thaliana. The rate of meiotic recombination between markers located in euchromatic regions was significantly higher in both heterozygous (DDM1/ddm1) and homozygous (ddm1/ddm1) backgrounds than in WT plants. The effect on recombination was similar for both male and female meiocytes. Contrary to expectations, ddm1 had no effect on the number of crossovers between markers in heterochromatic pericentric regions that underwent demethylation. These results are surprising, because the pericentromeric regions are hypermethylated and were expected to be the regions most affected by demethylation. Thus, DDM1 loss of function may trigger changes that enhance meiotic recombination in euchromatin regions but are not sufficient to induce the same events in heterochromatic segments. This work uncovers the repressive role of methylation on meiotic recombination in euchromatic regions and suggests that additional factors may have a role in controlling the suppression of recombination in heterochromatin.},

To extend this model, a genetic linkage map of microsatellite loci in the feline genome has been constructed including 246 autosomal and 7 X-linked loci. Two hundred thirty-five dinucleotide (dC {$\cdot$} dA)n{$\cdot$} (dG {$\cdot$} dT)nand 18 tetranucleotide repeat loci were identified and genotyped in a two-family, 108-member multigeneration interspecies backcross pedigree between the domestic cat (F. catus) and the Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis). Two hundred twenty-nine loci were linked to at least one other marker with a lod score {$\geq$}3.0, identifying 34 linkage groups. Representative markers from each linkage group were assigned to specific cat chromosomes by somatic cell hybrid analysis, resulting in chromosomal assignments to 16 of the 19 feline chromosomes. Genome coverage spans approximately 2900 cM, and we estimate a genetic length for the sex-averaged map as 3300 cM. The map has an average intragroup intermarker spacing of 11 cM and provides a valuable resource for mapping phenotypic variation in the species and relating it to gene maps of other mammals, including human.},

Large differences in recombination frequencies appear at several scales. On a large scale, regions of high and low rates of crossover have been found to alternate along the chromosomes in all plant species studied. High crossover rates have been reported to be correlated with several chromosome features (e.g. gene density and distance to the centromeres). However, most of these correlations cannot be extended to all plant species. Only a few plant species have been studied on a finer scale. Hotspots of meiotic recombination (i.e. DNA fragments of a few kilobases in length with a higher rate of recombination than the surrounding DNA) have been identified in maize and rice. Most of these hotspots are intragenic. In Arabidopsis thaliana, we have identified several DNA fragments (less than 5 kb in size) with genetic recombination rates at least 5 times higher than the whole-chromosome average [4.6 cM (centimorgan)/Mb], which are therefore probable hotspots for meiotic recombination. Most crossover breakpoints lie in intergenic or non-coding regions. Major efforts should be devoted to characterizing meiotic recombination at the molecular level, which should help to clarify the role of this process in genome evolution.},

Many of the genes with repressed recombination are located in large (50-100 kb) regions located near, but not at, the telomeres.

  abstract = {A hallmark of meiosis is the rearrangement of parental alleles to ensure genetic diversity in the gametes. These chromosome rearrangements are mediated by the repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as genetic crossovers between parental homologs. In mice, humans, and many other mammals, meiotic DSBs occur primarily at hotspots, determined by sequence-specific binding of the PRDM9 protein. Without PRDM9, meiotic DSBs occur near gene promoters and other functional sites. Studies in a limited number of mouse strains showed that functional PRDM9 is required to complete meiosis, but despite its apparent importance, Prdm9 has been repeatedly lost across many animal lineages. Both the reason for mouse sterility in the absence of PRDM9 and the mechanism by which Prdm9 can be lost remain unclear. Here, we explore whether mice can tolerate the loss of Prdm9. By generating Prdm9 functional knockouts in an array of genetic backgrounds, we observe a wide range of fertility phenotypes and ultimately demonstrate that PRDM9 is not required for completion of male meiosis. Although DSBs still form at a common subset of functional sites in all mice lacking PRDM9, meiotic outcomes differ substantially. We speculate that DSBs at functional sites are difficult to repair as a crossover and that by increasing the efficiency of crossover formation at these sites, genetic modifiers of recombination rates can allow for meiotic progression. This model implies that species with a sufficiently high recombination rate may lose Prdm9 yet remain fertile.},

In the construction of the family, two F1 males and 18 F1 females were intercrossed to generate 143 F2 offspring. The members of the family were genotyped using 243 genetic markers including 26 markers developed in our laboratory in order to generate a linkage map of markers for use in detecting quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in the family. The markers consisted of 237 microsatellites, five PRE-1 markers, and one RFLP marker. The linkage map was revealed to cover all 18 autosomes and the X chromosome; and the total length of the sex-averaged linkage map was calculated to be 2561.9 CM. Four out of the 26 markers developed in our laboratory exended the current linkage map at the termini of chromosomes 1p, 5p, 11p, and Xq. The linkage maps of all the chromosomes except for chromosome 1 were found to be longer in females than in males. Concerning chromosome 1, the length of the linkage map showed no difference between females and males, which was attributed to low recombination rates between markers localized in the centromeric region in females. The average ratio of female-to-male recombination was calculated to be 1.55.},

  abstract = {A century of genetic analysis has revealed that multiple mechanisms control the distribution of meiotic crossover events. In Drosophila melanogaster, two significant positional controls are interference and the strongly polar centromere effect. Here, we assess the factors controlling the distribution of crossovers (COs) and noncrossover gene conversions (NCOs) along all five major chromosome arms in 196 single meiotic divisions to generate a more detailed understanding of these controls on a genome-wide scale. Analyzing the outcomes of single meiotic events allows us to distinguish among different classes of meiotic recombination. In so doing, we identified 291 NCOs spread uniformly among the five major chromosome arms and 541 COs (including 52 double crossovers and one triple crossover). We find that unlike COs, NCOs are insensitive to the centromere effect and do not demonstrate interference. Although the positions of COs appear to be determined predominately by the long-range influences of interference and the centromere effect, each chromosome may display a different pattern of sensitivity to interference, suggesting that interference may not be a uniform global property. In addition, unbiased sequencing of a large number of individuals allows us to describe the formation of de novo copy number variants, the majority of which appear to be mediated by unequal crossing over between transposable elements. This work has multiple implications for our understanding of how meiotic recombination is regulated to ensure proper chromosome segregation and maintain genome stability.},

  abstract = {During sexual reproduction, one-half of the genetic material is deposited in gametes, and a complete set of chromosomes is restored upon fertilization. Reduction of the genetic information before gametogenesis occurs in meiosis, when cross-overs (COs) between homologous chromosomes secure an exchange of their genetic information. COs are not evenly distributed along chromosomes and are suppressed in chromosomal regions encompassing compact, hypermethylated centromeric and pericentromeric DNA. Therefore, it was postulated that DNA hypermethylation is inhibitory to COs. Here, when analyzing meiotic recombination in mutant plants with hypomethylated DNA, we observed unexpected and counterintuitive effects of DNA methylation losses on CO distribution. Recombination was further promoted in the hypomethylated chromosome arms while it was inhibited in heterochromatic regions encompassing pericentromeric DNA. Importantly, the total number of COs was not affected, implying that loss of DNA methylation led to a global redistribution of COs along chromosomes. To determine by which mechanisms altered levels of DNA methylation influence recombination\textemdash{}whether directly in cis or indirectly in trans by changing expression of genes encoding recombination components\textemdash{}we analyzed CO distribution in wild-type lines with randomly scattered and well-mapped hypomethylated chromosomal segments. The results of these experiments, supported by expression profiling data, suggest that DNA methylation affects meiotic recombination in cis. Because DNA methylation exhibits significant variation even within a single species, our results imply that it may influence the evolution of plant genomes through the control of meiotic recombination.},

Using population-scale sequencing, we have identified a high-quality set of 1.6 million indels from 179 individuals representing three diverse human populations. We show that rates of indel mutagenesis are highly heterogeneous, with 43\%\textendash{}48\% of indels occurring in 4.03\% of the genome, whereas in the remaining 96\% their prevalence is 16 times lower than SNPs. Polymerase slippage can explain upwards of three-fourths of all indels, with the remainder being mostly simple deletions in complex sequence. However, insertions do occur and are significantly associated with pseudo-palindromic sequence features compatible with the fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS) mechanism more commonly associated with large structural variations. We introduce a quantitative model of polymerase slippage, which enables us to identify indel-hypermutagenic protein-coding genes, some of which are associated with recurrent mutations leading to disease. Accounting for mutational rate heterogeneity due to sequence context, we find that indels across functional sequence are generally subject to stronger purifying selection than SNPs. We find that indel length modulates selection strength, and that indels affecting multiple functionally constrained nucleotides undergo stronger purifying selection. We further find that indels are enriched in associations with gene expression and find evidence for a contribution of nonsense-mediated decay. Finally, we show that indels can be integrated in existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS); although we do not find direct evidence that potentially causal protein-coding indels are enriched with associations to known disease-associated SNPs, our findings suggest that the causal variant underlying some of these associations may be indels.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is an essential feature of sexual reproduction that ensures faithful segregation of chromosomes and redistributes genetic variants in populations. Multiparent populations such as the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse stock accumulate large numbers of crossover (CO) events between founder haplotypes, and thus present a unique opportunity to study the role of genetic variation in shaping the recombination landscape. We obtained high-density genotype data from {$<$}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="http://www.genetics.org/sites/default/files/highwire/genetics/206/2/603/embed/mml-math-1.gif"/{$>$} DO mice, and localized 2.2 million CO events to intervals with a median size of 28 kb. The resulting sex-averaged genetic map of the DO population is highly concordant with large-scale (order 10 Mb) features of previously reported genetic maps for mouse. To examine fine-scale (order 10 kb) patterns of recombination in the DO, we overlaid putative recombination hotspots onto our CO intervals. We found that CO intervals are enriched in hotspots compared to the genomic background. However, as many as {$<$}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="http://www.genetics.org/sites/default/files/highwire/genetics/206/2/603/embed/mml-math-2.gif"/{$>$} of CO intervals do not overlap any putative hotspots, suggesting that our understanding of hotspots is incomplete. We also identified coldspots encompassing 329 Mb, or {$<$}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="http://www.genetics.org/sites/default/files/highwire/genetics/206/2/603/embed/mml-math-3.gif"/{$>$} of observable genome, in which there is little or no recombination. In contrast to hotspots, which are a few kilobases in size, and widely scattered throughout the genome, coldspots have a median size of 2.1 Mb and are spatially clustered. Coldspots are strongly associated with copy-number variant (CNV) regions, especially multi-allelic clusters, identified from whole-genome sequencing of 228 DO mice. Genes in these regions have reduced expression, and epigenetic features of closed chromatin in male germ cells, which suggests that CNVs may repress recombination by altering chromatin structure in meiosis. Our findings demonstrate how multiparent populations, by bridging the gap between large-scale and fine-scale genetic mapping, can reveal new features of the recombination landscape.},

In many species, this cellular mechanism occurs heterogeneously along chromosomes and mostly concentrates in tiny fragments called recombination hotspots. Specific DNA motifs have been shown to initiate recombination in these hotspots in mammals, fission yeast and drosophila. The aim of this study was to check whether recombination also occurs in a heterogeneous fashion in the highly recombinogenic honeybee genome and whether this heterogeneity can be connected with specific DNA motifs. We completed a previous picture drawn from a routine genetic map built with an average resolution of 93 kb. We focused on the two smallest honeybee chromosomes to increase the resolution and even zoomed at very high resolution (3.6 kb) on a fragment of 300 kb. Recombination rates measured in these fragments were placed in relation with occurrence of 30 previously described motifs through a Poisson regression model. A selection procedure suitable for correlated variables was applied to keep significant motifs. These fine and ultra-fine mappings show that recombination rate is significantly heterogeneous although poorly contrasted between high and low recombination rate, contrarily to most model species. We show that recombination rate is probably associated with the DNA methylation state. Moreover, three motifs (CGCA, GCCGC and CCAAT) are good candidates of signals promoting recombination. Their influence is however moderate, doubling at most the recombination rate. This discovery extends the way to recombination dissection in insects.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is a fundamental process needed for the correct segregation of chromosomes during meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms. In humans, 80\% of crossovers are estimated to occur at specific areas of the genome called recombination hotspots. Recently, a protein called PRDM9 was identified as a major player in determining the location of genome-wide meiotic recombination hotspots in humans and mice. The origin of this protein seems to be ancient in evolutionary time, as reflected by its fairly conserved structure in lineages that diverged over 700 million years ago. Despite its important role, there are many animal groups in which Prdm9 is absent (e.g. birds, reptiles, amphibians, diptera) and it has been suggested to have disruptive mutations and thus to be a pseudogene in dogs. Because of the dog's history through domestication and artificial selection, we wanted to confirm the presence of a disrupted Prdm9 gene in dogs and determine whether this was exclusive of this species or whether it also occurred in its wild ancestor, the wolf, and in a close relative, the coyote. We sequenced the region in the dog genome that aligned to the last exon of the human Prdm9, containing the entire zinc finger domain, in 4 dogs, 17 wolves and 2 coyotes. Our results show that the three canid species possess mutations that likely make this gene non functional. Because these mutations are shared across the three species, they must have appeared prior to the split of the wolf and the coyote, millions of years ago, and are not related to domestication. In addition, our results suggest that in these three canid species recombination does not occur at hotspots or hotspot location is controlled through a mechanism yet to be determined.},

We have previously identified DNA motifs that are enriched in hot spots, particularly the 7-mer CCTCCCT. Here we use the increased hot-spot resolution afforded by the Phase 2 HapMap and novel search methods to identify an extended family of motifs based around the degenerate 13-mer CCNCCNTNNCCNC, which is critical in recruiting crossover events to at least 40\% of all human hot spots and which operates on diverse genetic backgrounds in both sexes. Furthermore, these motifs are found in hypervariable minisatellites and are clustered in the breakpoint regions of both disease-causing nonallelic homologous recombination hot spots and common mitochondrial deletion hot spots, implicating the motif as a driver of genome instability.},

We report that a 13-bp sequence motif previously associated with the activity of 40\% of human hotspots does not function in chimpanzee, and is being removed by self-destructive drive in the human lineage. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the rapidly evolving zinc-finger protein, PRDM9 binds to this motif and that sequence changes in the protein may be responsible for hotspot differences between species. The involvement of PRDM9, which causes Histone H3 Lysine 4 trimethylation, implicates a common mechanism for recombination hotspots in eukaryotes but raises questions about what forces have driven such rapid change.},

Comparison of physical and genetic maps reveals variation on a scale of megabases, with substantial differences between sexes. Recombination is often suppressed near centromeres and elevated near telomeres, but neither of these observations is true for all chromosomes. In humans, patterns of linkage disequilibrium and experimental measures of recombination from sperm-typing reveal dramatic hotspots of recombination on a scale of kilobases. Genome-wide variation in the amount of crossing-over may be due to variation in the density of hotspots, the intensity of hotspots, or both. Theoretical models of selection and linkage predict that genetic variation will be reduced in regions of low recombination, and this prediction is supported by data from several species. Heterogeneity in rates of crossing-over provides both an opportunity and a challenge for identifying disease genes: as associations occur in blocks, genomic regions containing disease loci may be identified with relatively few markers, yet identifying the causal mutations is unlikely to be achieved through associations alone.},

  abstract = {Rare gene knockouts in adult humans
On average, most people's genomes contain approximately 100 completely nonfunctional genes. These loss-of-function (LOF) mutations tend to be rare and/or occur only as a single copy within individuals. Narasimhan et al. investigated LOF in a Pakistani population with high levels of consanguinity. Examining LOF alleles that were identical by descent, they found, as expected, an absence of homozygote LOF for certain protein-coding genes. However, they also identified many homozygote LOF alleles with no apparent deleterious phenotype, including some that were expected to confer genetic disease. Indeed, one family had lost the recombination-associated gene PRDM9.
Science, this issue p. 474
Examining complete gene knockouts within a viable organism can inform on gene function. We sequenced the exomes of 3222 British adults of Pakistani heritage with high parental relatedness, discovering 1111 rare-variant homozygous genotypes with predicted loss of function (knockouts) in 781 genes. We observed 13.7\% fewer homozygous knockout genotypes than we expected, implying an average load of 1.6 recessive-lethal-equivalent loss-of-function (LOF) variants per adult. When genetic data were linked to the individuals' lifelong health records, we observed no significant relationship between gene knockouts and clinical consultation or prescription rate. In this data set, we identified a healthy PRDM9-knockout mother and performed phased genome sequencing on her, her child, and control individuals. Our results show that meiotic recombination sites are localized away from PRDM9-dependent hotspots. Thus, natural LOF variants inform on essential genetic loci and demonstrate PRDM9 redundancy in humans.
The total loss of protein-coding genes, even those with the potential to confer genetic diseases, can be tolerated.

A comprehensive genetic linkage map would afford many opportunities in dogs, ranging from the positional cloning of disease genes to the dissection of quantitative differences in size, shape, and behavior. Here we report a canine linkage map with the number of mapped loci expanded to 276 and 10-cM coverage extended to 75-90\% of the genome. Most of the 38 canine autosomes are likely represented in the collection of 39 autosomal linkage groups. Eight markers were sufficiently informative to detect linkage at distances of 10-13 cM, yet remained unlinked to any other marker. Taken together, the results suggested a genome size of about 27 M. As in other species, the genetic length varied between sexes, with the female autosomal distance being approximately 1.4-fold greater than that of male meioses. Fifteen markers anchored well-described genes on the map, thereby serving as landmarks for comparative mapping in dogs. We discuss the utility of the current map and outline steps necessary for future map improvement.},

Heterozygosity for rearrangements decreases the frequency of Wx gametes to varying degrees.-Heterozygosity for Tp9 enhances the proportion of Wx gametes that are apparent convertants and allows the conclusion that such gametes do not normally arise from an exchange in the wx locus plus a second exchange distal to wx. Heterozygosity for In9a markedly decreases the frequency of Wx gametes that are recombinant for outside markers but does not decrease the frequency of convertants.-Heterozygosity for Rearr 9 permits a low frequency of Wx gametes, all of which are apparent convertants.-A high proportion of the convertants have the flanking markers that entered the cross with C so recombination is polarized in normal homologs and in heterozygotes for all rearrangements.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination differs from mitotic recombination in that DSBs are repaired using homologous chromosomes, rather than sister chromatids. This change in partner choice is due in part to a barrier to sister chromatid repair (BSCR) created by the meiosis-specific kinase, Mek1, in a complex with two other meiosis-specific proteins, Hop1 and Red1. HOP1 contains two functional domains, called the N and C domains. Analysis of a point mutation that specifically inactivates the C domain (hop1-K593A) reveals that the N domain is sufficient for Hop1 localization to chromosomes and for Red1 and Hop1 interactions. The C domain is needed for spore viability, for chromosome synapsis, and for preventing DMC1-independent DSB repair, indicating it plays a role in the BSCR. All of the hop1-K593A phenotypes can be bypassed by fusion of ectopic dimerization domains to Mek1, suggesting that the function of the C domain is to promote Mek1 dimerization. Hop1 is a DSB-dependent phosphoprotein, whose phosphorylation requires the presence of the C domain, but is independent of MEK1. These results suggest a model in which Hop1 phosphorylation in response to DSBs triggers dimerization of Mek1 via the Hop1 C domain, thereby enabling Mek1 to phosphorylate target proteins that prevent repair of DSBs by sister chromatids.},

To uncover the regulatory mechanisms active in DSB formation, we have monitored the change in local chromatin structure at the ARG4 and CYS3 recombination hot spots over the course of meiosis. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion of isolated meiotic chromatin followed by indirect end-labeling revealed that the DSB sites in both loci are hypersensitive to MNase and that their sensitivity increases 2- to 4-fold prior to the appearance of meiotic DSBs and recombination products. Other sensitive sites are not significantly altered. The study of hyper- and hypo-recombinogenic constructs at the ARG4 locus, also revealed that the MNase sensitivity at the DSB site correlates with both the extent of DSBs and the rate of gene conversion. These results suggest that the local chromatin structure and its modification in early meiosis play an important role in the positioning and frequency of meiotic DSBs, leading to meiotic recombination.},

Then in 1956, Seymour Benzer published his classic paper describing crossing over within a gene, intragenic recombination. This result from a bacteriophage gene prompted Oliver Nelson to study intragenic recombination in the maize Waxy locus. His studies along with subsequent work by others working with maize and other plants described the outcomes of intragenic recombination and provided some of the earliest evidence that genes, not intergenic regions, were recombination hotspots. High-throughput genotyping approaches have since replaced single gene intragenic studies for characterizing the outcomes of recombination. These large-scale studies confirm that genes, or more generally genic regions, are the most active recombinogenic regions, and suggested a pattern of crossovers similar to the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In S. cerevisiae recombination is initiated by double-strand breaks near transcription start sites of genes producing a polarity gradient where crossovers preferentially resolve at the 5' end of genes. The findings of preferential recombination at maize gene ends in genomic studies contrasts with older intragenic studies where there was less evidence for either polarity or for double-strand breaks near transcription start sites initiating recombination. Reasons for these different perspectives are due to the different depth and breadth of single locus versus genome-wide studies, and highlight how drawing upon the strengths of both approaches can provide a clearer picture of recombination in maize.},

  abstract = {The onset of prezygotic and postzygotic barriers to gene flow between populations is a hallmark of speciation. One of the earliest postzygotic isolating barriers to arise between incipient species is the sterility of the heterogametic sex in interspecies' hybrids. Four genes that underlie hybrid sterility have been identified in animals: Odysseus, JYalpha, and Overdrive in Drosophila and Prdm9 (Meisetz) in mice. Mouse Prdm9 encodes a protein with a KRAB motif, a histone methyltransferase domain and several zinc fingers. The difference of a single zinc finger distinguishes Prdm9 alleles that cause hybrid sterility from those that do not. We find that concerted evolution and positive selection have rapidly altered the number and sequence of Prdm9 zinc fingers across 13 rodent genomes. The patterns of positive selection in Prdm9 zinc fingers imply that rapid evolution has acted on the interface between the Prdm9 protein and the DNA sequences to which it binds. Similar patterns are apparent for Prdm9 zinc fingers for diverse metazoans, including primates. Indeed, allelic variation at the DNA\textendash{}binding positions of human PRDM9 zinc fingers show significant association with decreased risk of infertility. Prdm9 thus plays a role in determining male sterility both between species (mouse) and within species (human). The recurrent episodes of positive selection acting on Prdm9 suggest that the DNA sequences to which it binds must also be evolving rapidly. Our findings do not identify the nature of the underlying DNA sequences, but argue against the proposed role of Prdm9 as an essential transcription factor in mouse meiosis. We propose a hypothetical model in which incompatibilities between Prdm9-binding specificity and satellite DNAs provide the molecular basis for Prdm9-mediated hybrid sterility. We suggest that Prdm9 should be investigated as a candidate gene in other instances of hybrid sterility in metazoans.},

  abstract = {Recently many exciting advances have been achieved in our understanding of Drosophila meiosis due to combined cytological and genetic approaches. New techniques have permitted the characterization of chromosome position and spindle formation in female meiosis I. The proteins encoded by the nod and ncd genes, two genes known to be needed for the proper partitioning of chromosomes lacking exchange events, have been identified and found to be kinesin-like motors. The effects of mutations in these genes on the spindle and chromosomes, together with the localization of the proteins, have yielded a model for the mechanism of female meiosis I. In male meiosis I, the chromosomal regions responsible for homolog pairing have been resolved to the level of specific DNA sequences. This provides a foundation for elucidating the molecular basis of meiotic pairing. The cytological techniques available in Drosophila also have permitted inroads into the regulation of sister-chromatid segregation. The products of two genes (mei-S332 and ord) essential for sister-chromatid cohesion have been identified recently. Additional advances in understanding Drosophila meiosis are the delineation of a functional centromere by using minichromosome derivatives and the identification of several regulatory genes for the meiotic cell cycle.},

  abstract = {Among mammals, genetic recombination occurs at highly delimited sites known as recombination hotspots. They are typically 1\textendash{}2 kb long and vary as much as a 1,000-fold or more in recombination activity. Although much is known about the molecular details of the recombination process itself, the factors determining the location and relative activity of hotspots are poorly understood. To further our understanding, we have collected and mapped the locations of 5,472 crossover events along mouse Chromosome 1 arising in 6,028 meioses of male and female reciprocal F1 hybrids of C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ mice. Crossovers were mapped to a minimum resolution of 225 kb, and those in the telomere-proximal 24.7 Mb were further mapped to resolve individual hotspots. Recombination rates were evolutionarily conserved on a regional scale, but not at the local level. There was a clear negative-exponential relationship between the relative activity and abundance of hotspot activity classes, such that a small number of the most active hotspots account for the majority of recombination. Females had 1.2\texttimes{} higher overall recombination than males did, although the sex ratio showed considerable regional variation. Locally, entirely sex-specific hotspots were rare. The initiation of recombination at the most active hotspot was regulated independently on the two parental chromatids, and analysis of reciprocal crosses indicated that parental imprinting has subtle effects on recombination rates. It appears that the regulation of mammalian recombination is a complex, dynamic process involving multiple factors reflecting species, sex, individual variation within species, and the properties of individual hotspots., In most eukaryotic organisms, recombination\textemdash{}the exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosomes\textemdash{}ensures the proper recognition and segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. Recombination events in mammals are not randomly positioned along the chromosomes but occur in preferential 1\textendash{}2-kilobase sequences termed hotspots. Different species such as humans and mice do not share hotspots, although the same principles almost certainly regulate their placement in the genome. Hotspot positions and activities depend on genetic background and show sex-specific differences. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of recombination activity along the largest mouse chromosome, finding that recombination is regulated on multiple levels, including regional positioning relative to the chromosomal ends, local gene content, sex-specific mechanisms of hotspot recognition, and parental origin. Our results will contribute to further understanding of one of the most fundamental biological processes and are likely to cast light on several aspects of population genetics and evolutionary biology, as well as enhance our practical ability to define the genetic components of human disease.},

Our analysis supports the view that the recombination terrain is molded by combinatorial and hierarchical interaction of factors that work on widely different size scales. Mechanistic aspects of DSB formation and early processing steps are also uncovered. This map illuminates the occurrence of DSBs in repetitive DNA elements, repair of which can lead to chromosomal rearrangements.

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is required for the orderly segregation of chromosomes during meiosis and for providing genetic diversity among offspring. Among mammals, as well as yeast and higher plants, recombination preferentially occurs at highly delimited chromosomal sites 1-2 kb long known as hotspots. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the roles various proteins play in carrying out the molecular events of the recombination process, relatively little is understood about the factors controlling the location and relative activity of mammalian recombination hotspots. To search for trans-acting factors controlling the positioning of recombination events, we compared the locations of crossovers arising in an 8-Mb segment of a 100-Mb region of mouse Chromosome 1 (Chr 1) when the longer region was heterozygous C57BL/6J (B6) x CAST/EiJ (CAST) and the remainder of the genome was either similarly heterozygous or entirely homozygous B6. The lack of CAST alleles in the remainder of the genome resulted in profound changes in hotspot activity in both females and males. Recombination activity was lost at several hotspots; new, previously undetected hotspots appeared; and still other hotspots remained unaffected, indicating the presence of distant trans-acting gene(s) whose CAST allele(s) activate or suppress the activity of specific hotspots. Testing the activity of three activated hotspots in sperm samples from individual male progeny of two genetic crosses, we identified a single trans-acting regulator of hotspot activity, designated Rcr1, that is located in a 5.30-Mb interval (11.74-17.04 Mb) on Chr 17. Using an Escherichia coli cloning assay to characterize the molecular products of recombination at two of these hotspots, we found that Rcr1 controls the appearance of both crossover and noncrossover gene conversion events, indicating that it likely controls the sites of the double-strand DNA breaks that initiate the recombination process.},

  abstract = {There is growing evidence that in a variety of organisms the majority of meiotic recombination events occur at a relatively small fraction of loci, known as recombination hotspots. If hotspot activity results from the DNA sequence at or near the hotspot itself (in cis), these hotspots are expected to be rapidly lost due to biased gene conversion, unless there is strong selection in favor of the hotspot itself. This phenomenon makes it very difficult to maintain existing hotspots and even more difficult for new hotspots to evolve; it has therefore come to be known as the ``hotspot conversion paradox.'' I develop an analytical framework for exploring the evolution of recombination hotspots under the forces of selection, mutation, and conversion. I derive the general conditions under which cis- and trans-controlled hotspots can be maintained, as well as those under which new hotspots controlled by both a cis and a trans locus can invade a population. I show that the conditions for maintenance of and invasion by trans- or cis-plus-trans-controlled hotspots are broader than for those controlled entirely in cis. Finally, I show that a combination of cis and trans control may allow for long-lived polymorphisms in hotspot activity, the patterns of which may explain some recently observed features of recombination hotspots.},

This ``hotspot paradox'' has been reinforced by the finding that biased gene conversion also removes active hotspots from human sperm. To investigate the requirements for hotspot persistence, we developed a detailed computer simulation model of their activity and its evolutionary consequences. With this model, unopposed hotspot activity could drive strong hotspots from 50\% representation to extinction within 70 generations. Although the crossing over that hotspots cause can increase population fitness, this benefit was always too small to slow the loss of hotspots. Hotspots could not be maintained by plausible rates of de novo mutation, nor by crossover interference, which alters the frequency and/or spacing of crossovers. Competition among hotspots for activity-limiting factors also did not prevent their extinction, although the rate of hotspot loss was slowed. Key factors were the probability that the initiating hotspot allele is destroyed and the nonmeiotic contributions hotspots make to fitness. Experimental investigation of these deserves high priority, because until the paradox is resolved all components of the mechanism are open to doubt.},

Second, recombination facilitates the impact of natural selection by shuffling genomic sequences. Furthermore, the action of certain repair mechanisms during recombination affects the frequencies of alleles in populations via biased gene conversion. Lately, the numerous advancements in the study of recombination have unraveled the complexity of this process regarding both its mechanisms and evolution. The main aim of this thesis is to analyze the relationships between the different causes, characteristics, and effects of recombination from an evolutionary perspective. First, we developed a model based on the control mechanisms of meiosis and inter-crossover interference. We further used this model to compare the recombination strategies in multiple vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as between sexes. Second, we studied the impact of the sex-specific localization of recombination hotspots on the evolution of the GC content for several vertebrates. Last, we built a population genetics model to analyze the impact of recombination on the frequency of deleterious mutation in the human population.},

  abstract = {In many mammals, including humans and mice, the zinc finger histone methyltransferase PRDM9 performs the first step in meiotic recombination by specifying the locations of hotspots, the sites of genetic recombination. PRDM9 binds to DNA at hotspots through its zinc finger domain and activates recombination by trimethylating histone H3K4 on adjacent nucleosomes through its PR/SET domain. Recently, the isolated PR/SET domain of PRDM9 was shown capable of also trimethylating H3K36 in vitro, raising the question of whether this reaction occurs in vivo during meiosis, and if so, what its function might be. Here, we show that full-length PRDM9 does trimethylate H3K36 in vivo in mouse spermatocytes. Levels of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 are highly correlated at hotspots, but mutually exclusive elsewhere. In vitro, we find that although PRDM9 trimethylates H3K36 much more slowly than it does H3K4, PRDM9 is capable of placing both marks on the same histone molecules. In accord with these results, we also show that PRDM9 can trimethylate both K4 and K36 on the same nucleosomes in vivo, but the ratio of K4me3/K36me3 is much higher for the pair of nucleosomes adjacent to the PRDM9 binding site compared to the next pair further away. Importantly, H3K4me3/H3K36me3-double-positive nucleosomes occur only in regions of recombination: hotspots and the pseudoautosomal (PAR) region of the sex chromosomes. These double-positive nucleosomes are dramatically reduced when PRDM9 is absent, showing that this signature is PRDM9-dependent at hotspots; the residual double-positive nucleosomes most likely come from the PRDM9-independent PAR. These results, together with the fact that PRDM9 is the only known mammalian histone methyltransferase with both H3K4 and H3K36 trimethylation activity, suggest that trimethylation of H3K36 plays an important role in the recombination process. Given the known requirement of H3K36me3 for double strand break repair by homologous recombination in somatic cells, we suggest that it may play the same role in meiosis.},

  abstract = {Recombination between homologous chromosomes is crucial to ensure their proper segregation during meiosis. This is achieved by regulating the choice of recombination template. In mitotic cells, double-strand break repair with the sister chromatid appears to be preferred, whereas interhomolog recombination is favoured during meiosis. However, in the last year, several studies in yeast have shown the importance of the meiotic recombination between sister chromatids. Although this thinking seems to be new, evidences for sister chromatid exchange during meiosis were obtained more than 50 years ago in non-model organisms. In this mini-review, we comment briefly on the most recent advances in this hot topic and also describe observations which suggest the existence of inter-sister repair during meiotic recombination. For instance, the behaviour of mammalian XY bivalents and that of trivalents in heterozygotes for chromosomal rearrangements are cited as examples. The ``rediscovering'' of the requirement for the sister template, although it seems to occur at a low frequency, will probably prompt further investigations in organisms other than yeast to understand the complexity of the partner choice during meiosis.},

Furthermore, our data indicate that DSB frequency is a major determinant of crossover rate.

Moreover, the crossover asymmetry observed in a subset of these has led to the suggestion that hotspots may be short-lived on an evolutionary time scale. To test this possibility, we focused on a region known to contain a recombination hotspot in humans, TAP2, and asked whether chimpanzees, the closest living evolutionary relatives of humans, harbor a hotspot in a similar location. Specifically, we used a new statistical approach to estimate recombination rate variation from patterns of linkage disequilibrium in a sample of 24 western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). This method has been shown to produce reliable results on simulated data and on human data from the TAP2 region. Strikingly, however, it finds very little support for recombination rate variation at TAP2 in the western chimpanzee data. Moreover, simulations suggest that there should be stronger support if there were a hotspot similar to the one characterized in humans. Thus, it appears that the human TAP2 recombination hotspot is not shared by western chimpanzees. These findings demonstrate that fine-scale recombination rates can change between very closely related species and raise the possibility that rates differ among human populations, with important implications for linkage-disequilibrium based association studies.},

Here we determined to what degree recombination rates are conserved among closely related species by estimating recombination rates from 14 Mb of linkage disequilibrium data in central chimpanzee and human populations.

  abstract = {The intimate synapsis of homologous chromosome pairs (homologs) by synaptonemal complexes (SCs) is an essential feature of meiosis. In many organisms, synapsis and homologous recombination are interdependent: recombination promotes SC formation and SCs are required for crossing-over. Moreover, several studies indicate that initiation of SC assembly occurs at sites where crossovers will subsequently form. However, recent analyses in budding yeast and fruit fly imply a special role for centromeres in the initiation of SC formation. In addition, in budding yeast, persistent SC\textendash{}dependent centromere-association facilitates the disjunction of chromosomes that have failed to become connected by crossovers. Here, we examine the interplay between SCs, recombination, and centromeres in a mammal. In mouse spermatocytes, centromeres do not serve as SC initiation sites and are invariably the last regions to synapse. However, centromeres are refractory to de-synapsis during diplonema and remain associated by short SC fragments. Since SC\textendash{}dependent centromere association is lost before diakinesis, a direct role in homolog segregation seems unlikely. However, post\textendash{}SC disassembly, we find evidence of inter-centromeric connections that could play a more direct role in promoting homolog biorientation and disjunction. A second class of persistent SC fragments is shown to be crossover-dependent. Super-resolution structured-illumination microscopy (SIM) reveals that these structures initially connect separate homolog axes and progressively diminish as chiasmata form. Thus, DNA crossing-over (which occurs during pachynema) and axis remodeling appear to be temporally distinct aspects of chiasma formation. SIM analysis of the synapsis and crossover-defective mutant Sycp1-/- implies that SCs prevent unregulated fusion of homolog axes. We propose that SC fragments retained during diplonema stabilize nascent bivalents and help orchestrate local chromosome reorganization that promotes centromere and chiasma function.},

  abstract = {Mutations accumulate during all stages of growth, but only germ line mutations contribute to evolution. While meiosis contributes to evolution by reassortment of parental alleles, we show here that the process itself is inherently mutagenic. We have previously shown that the DNA synthesis associated with repair of a double-strand break is about 1000-fold less accurate than S-phase synthesis. Since the process of meiosis involves many programmed DSBs, we reasoned that this repair might also be mutagenic. Indeed, in the early 1960{${'}$}s Magni and Von Borstel observed elevated reversion of recessive alleles during meiosis, and found that the revertants were more likely to be associated with a crossover than non-revertants, a process that they called ``the meiotic effect.'' Here we use a forward mutation reporter (CAN1 HIS3) placed at either a meiotic recombination coldspot or hotspot near the MAT locus on Chromosome III. We find that the increased mutation rate at CAN1 (6 to 21 \textendash{}fold) correlates with the underlying recombination rate at the locus. Importantly, we show that the elevated mutation rate is fully dependent upon Spo11, the protein that introduces the meiosis specific DSBs. To examine associated recombination we selected for random spores with or without a mutation in CAN1. We find that the mutations isolated this way show an increased association with recombination (crossovers, loss of crossover interference and/or increased gene conversion tracts). Pol{$\zeta$} appears to contribute about half of the mutations induced during meiosis, but is not the only source of mutations for the meiotic effect. We see no difference in either the spectrum or distribution of mutations between mitosis and meiosis. The correlation of hotspots with elevated mutagenesis provides a mechanism for organisms to control evolution rates in a gene specific manner., Meiosis, the cellular division that gives rise to germ cells, contributes to evolution by reassortment of parental alleles. This process involves recombination initiated by Spo11-induced double-strand breaks early in meiosis. The result is that germ cells from a single meiosis are different from either parent. Here we show that the DNA repair associated with meiotic recombination is inherently mutagenic, providing an additional source of variation that can contribute to evolution. This elevated mutagenesis requires the Spo11 protein, and the rate of mutagenesis correlates positively with the frequency of meiotic double-strand breaks. Furthermore, the mutations that arise show an increased level of associated crossovers, consistent with having been introduced during recombination. We speculate that there is an evolutionary drive to position essential genes in meiotic recombination coldspots for slow evolution, and genes that can afford to evolve more rapidly are placed near meiotic recombination hotspots.},

To better understand factors that control the distribution of DSBs in budding yeast, we have examined the genome-wide binding and cleavage properties of the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4BD)-Spo11 fusion protein. We found that Gal4BD-Spo11 cleaves only a subset of its binding sites, indicating that the association of Spo11 with chromatin is not sufficient for DSB formation. In centromere-associated regions, the centromere itself prevents DSB cleavage by tethered Gal4BD-Spo11 since its displacement restores targeted DSB formation. In addition, we observed that new DSBs introduced by Gal4BD-Spo11 inhibit surrounding DSB formation over long distances (up to 60 kb), keeping constant the number of DSBs per chromosomal region. Together, these results demonstrate that the targeting of Spo11 to new chromosomal locations leads to both local stimulation and genome-wide redistribution of recombination initiation and that some chromosomal regions are inherently cold regardless of the presence of Spo11.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In budding yeast, Sgs1 is the sole member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases. Like the human Bloom syndrome helicase (BLM), Sgs1 functions during both vegetative growth and meiosis. The sgs1 null mutant sporulates poorly and displays reduced spore viability.
RESULTS: We have identified novel functions for Sgs1 in meiosis. Loss of Sgs1 increases the number of axial associations, which are connections between homologous chromosomes that serve as initiation sites for synaptonemal complex formation. In addition, mutation of SGS1 increases the number of synapsis initiation complexes and increases the rate of chromosome synapsis. Loss of Sgs1 also increases the number of meiotic crossovers without changing the frequency of gene conversion. The sgs1 defect in sporulation is due to checkpoint-induced arrest/delay at the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase. A non-null allele of SGS1 that specifically deletes the helicase domain is defective in the newly described meiotic functions of Sgs1, but wild-type for most vegetative functions and for spore formation.
CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that the helicase domain of Sgs1 serves as a negative regulator of meiotic interchromosomal interactions. The activity of the wild-type Sgs1 protein reduces the numbers of axial associations, synapsis initiation complexes, and crossovers, and decreases the rate of chromosome synapsis. Our data argue strongly that axial associations marked by synapsis initiation complexes correspond to sites of reciprocal exchange. We propose that the Sgs1 helicase prevents a subset of recombination intermediates from becoming crossovers, and this distinction is made at an early stage in meiotic prophase.},

In mammals, the majority of meiotic chromosome segregation errors result from a lack of COs between homologs. Observations in Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster have revealed a second class of exceptional events in which a CO occurred near the centromere of the missegregated chromosome. We show that in wild-type strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, most spore inviability is due to precocious separation of sister chromatids (PSSC) and that PSSC is often associated with centromere-proximal crossing over. COs, as opposed to nonreciprocal recombination events (NCOs), are preferentially associated with missegregation. Strains mutant for the RecQ homolog, SGS1, display reduced spore viability and increased crossing over. Much of the spore inviability in sgs1 results from PSSC, and these events are often associated with centromere-proximal COs, just as in wild type. When crossing over in sgs1 is reduced by the introduction of a nonnull allele of SPO11, spore viability is improved, suggesting that the increased PSSC is due to increased crossing over. We present a model for PSSC in which a centromere-proximal CO promotes local loss of sister-chromatid cohesion.},

By monitoring repair events at a defined double-strand break (DSB) site during Caenorhabditis elegans meiosis, we reveal mechanisms that ensure formation of the obligate CO while limiting CO number. We find that CO is the preferred DSB repair outcome in the absence of inhibitory effects of other (nascent) recombination events. Thus, a single DSB per chromosome pair is largely sufficient to ensure CO formation. Further, we show that access to the homolog as a repair template is regulated, shutting down simultaneously for both CO and noncrossover (NCO) pathways. We propose that regulation of interhomolog access limits CO number and contributes to CO interference.},

However, little is known about the distribution of COs at the sequence level. To investigate this, we studied in detail the pattern of COs along a contig of 3.110 Mb using two F2 segregating populations (Chinese Spring \texttimes{} Renan (F2-CsRe) and Chinese Spring \texttimes{} Courtot (F2-CsCt)) each containing \textasciitilde{}2,000 individuals. The availability of the sequence of the contig from Cs enabled the development of 318 markers among which 23 co-dominant polymorphic markers (11 SSRs and 12 SNPs) were selected for CO distribution analyses. The distribution of CO events was not homogeneous throughout the contig, ranging from 0.05 to 2.77 cM/Mb, but was conserved between the two populations despite very different contig recombination rate averages (0.82 cM/Mb in F2-CsRe vs 0.35 cM/Mb in F2-CsCt). The CO frequency was correlated with the percentage of coding sequence in Cs and with the polymorphism rate between Cs and Re or Ct in both populations, indicating an impact of these two factors on CO distribution. At a finer scale, COs were found in a region covering 2.38 kb, spanning a gene coding for a glycosyl transferase (Hga3), suggesting the presence of a CO hotspot. A non-crossover event covering at least 453 bp was also identified in the same interval. From these results, we can conclude that gene content could be one of the factors driving recombination in bread wheat.},

Nevertheless, the components of the recombination apparatus remain incompletely characterized in mammals. One approach to identify such components is to identify the genes that underlie inherited variation in recombination phenotypes. In addition to providing mechanistic insights, this would allow the study of the evolutionary forces that shape the recombination process. In this paper, we take advantage of genotypes for 50,000 genome-wide SNP markers to measure four recombination phenotypes (genome-wide recombination rate, genome-wide hotspot usage, locus-specific recombination rate, genome-wide cross-over interference) for {$>$}750 bulls on the basis of {$>$}250,000 cross-overs detected in sperm cells transmitted to {$>$}10,000 sons.

In prokaryotes, enzymes responsible for HJ resolution are well characterized but the identification of a eukaryotic nuclear HJ resolvase has been elusive. Indirect evidence suggests that MUS81 from humans and fission yeast encodes a HJ resolvase. We provide three lines of evidence that Mus81/Mms4 is not the major meiotic HJ resolvase in S. cerevisiae: (1) MUS81/MMS4 is required to form only a distinct subset of crossovers; (2) rather than accumulating, dHJ intermediates are reduced in an mms4 mutant; and (3) expression of a bacterial HJ resolvase has no suppressive effect on mus81 meiotic phenotypes. Our analysis also reveals the existence of two distinct classes of crossovers in budding yeast. Class I is dependent upon MSH4/MSH5 and exhibits crossover interference, while class II is dependent upon MUS81/MMS4 and exhibits no interference. mms4 specifically reduces crossing over on small chromosomes, which are known to undergo less interference. The correlation between recombination rate and degree of interference to chromosome size may therefore be achieved by modulating the balance between class I/class II crossovers.},

  abstract = {Recombination plays a fundamental role in meiosis. Non-exchange gene conversion (non-crossover, NCO) may facilitate homologue pairing, while reciprocal crossover (CO) physically connects homologues so they orientate appropriately on the meiotic spindle. In males, X-Y homologous pairing and exchange occurs within the two pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) together comprising {$<$}5\% of the human sex chromosomes. Successful meiosis depends on an obligatory CO within PAR1, while the nature and role of exchange within PAR2 is unclear. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a typical \textasciitilde{}1 kb wide recombination hotspot within PAR2. We find that both COs and NCOs are strongly modulated in trans by the presumed chromatin remodelling protein PRDM9, and in cis by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at the hotspot centre that appears to influence recombination initiation and which causes biased gene conversion in SNP heterozygotes. This, the largest survey to date of human NCOs reveals for the first time substantial inter-individual variation in the NCO:CO ratio. Although the extent of biased transmission at the central marker in COs is similar across men, it is highly variable among NCO recombinants. This suggests that cis-effects are mediated not only through recombination initiation frequencies varying between haplotypes but also through subsequent processing, with the potential to significantly intensify meiotic drive of hotspot-suppressing alleles. The NCO:CO ratio and extent of transmission distortion among NCOs appear to be inter-related, suggesting the existence of two NCO pathways in humans.},

In order to investigate the effect of ade6-M26 on crossover frequency, heteroallelic ade6 duplications were constructed by integration of plasmids carrying the marker gene ura4. One ade6 gene carries either of the mutations M26 or M375 while the other ade6 copy carries the L469 mutation in both duplications. The duplication with ade6-M26 yields Ade(+) recombinants at significantly higher frequencies in meiosis, but not in mitosis. Tetrad analysis and physical characterization of spore clones from recombination tetrads demonstrate that conversions, unequal crossovers and intrachromatid exchanges occur at higher frequencies but with unaltered proportions among them. The conversion events show a pronounced bias when M26 is involved: they take place preferentially at the M26 allele. Thus the ade6-M26 mutation not only enhances conversion frequency as demonstrated before, but also crossover frequency. It displays the properties expected for a preferred site of initiation of general meiotic recombination. The duplications also yielded new information on ectopic recombination in S. pombe: ectopic crossovers occur in the duplications at much higher frequency than among naturally dispersed homologous sequences.},

  abstract = {Meiotic crossovers (COs) have two important roles, shuffling genetic information and ensuring proper chromosome segregation. Despite their importance and a large excess of precursors (i.e., DNA double-strand breaks, DSBs), the number of COs is tightly regulated, typically one to three per chromosome pair. The mechanisms ensuring that most DSBs are repaired as non-COs and the evolutionary forces imposing this constraint are poorly understood. Here we identified Topoisomerase3{$\alpha$} (TOP3{$\alpha$}) and the RECQ4 helicases--the Arabidopsis slow growth suppressor 1 (Sgs1)/Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) homologs--as major barriers to meiotic CO formation. First, the characterization of a specific TOP3{$\alpha$} mutant allele revealed that, in addition to its role in DNA repair, this topoisomerase antagonizes CO formation. Further, we found that RECQ4A and RECQ4B constitute the strongest meiotic anti-CO activity identified to date, their concomitant depletion leading to a sixfold increase in CO frequency. In both top3{$\alpha$} and recq4ab mutants, DSB number is unaffected, and extra COs arise from a normally minor pathway. Finally, both TOP3{$\alpha$} and RECQ4A/B act independently of the previously identified anti-CO Fanconi anemia of complementation group M (FANCM) helicase. This finding shows that several parallel pathways actively limit CO formation and suggests that the RECQA/B and FANCM helicases prevent COs by processing different substrates. Despite a ninefold increase in CO frequency, chromosome segregation was unaffected. This finding supports the idea that CO number is restricted not because of mechanical constraints but likely because of the long-term costs of recombination. Furthermore, this work demonstrates how manipulating a few genes holds great promise for increasing recombination frequency in plant-breeding programs.},

  abstract = {Recombination allows faithful chromosomal segregation during meiosis and contributes to the production of new heritable allelic variants that are essential for the maintenance of genetic diversity. Therefore, an appreciation of how this variation is created and maintained is of critical importance to our understanding of biodiversity and evolutionary change. Here, we analysed the recombination features from species representing the major eutherian taxonomic groups Afrotheria, Rodentia, Primates and Carnivora to better understand the dynamics of mammalian recombination. Our results suggest a phylogenetic component in recombination rates (RRs), which appears to be directional, strongly punctuated and subject to selection. Species that diversified earlier in the evolutionary tree have lower RRs than those from more derived phylogenetic branches. Furthermore, chromosome-specific recombination maps in distantly related taxa show that crossover interference is especially weak in the species with highest RRs detected thus far, the tiger. This is the first example of a mammalian species exhibiting such low levels of crossover interference, highlighting the uniqueness of this species and its relevance for the study of the mechanisms controlling crossover formation, distribution and resolution.},

In plants, differences in the meiotic pathway have been observed, by using methods for 3-D optical imaging, between the polyploids maize and wheat.

  abstract = {Recombination between the X and Y chromosomes is limited to the pseudoautosomal region and is necessary for proper segregation of the sex chromosomes during spermatogenesis. Failure of the sex chromosomes to disjoin properly during meiosis can result in individuals with a 47,XXY constitution, and approximately one-half of these result from paternal nondisjunction at meiosis I. Analysis of individuals with paternally derived 47,XXY has shown that the majority are the result of meiosis in which the X and Y chromosomes have failed to recombine. Our studies of sperm have demonstrated that aneuploid 24,XY sperm have a decreased recombination frequency, compared with that of normal sperm. Some studies have indicated a relationship of increased paternal age with 47,XXY offspring and with the production of XY disomic sperm, whereas others have failed to find such relationships. To determine whether there is a relationship between paternal age and recombination in the pseudoautosomal region, single-sperm genotyping was performed to measure the frequency of recombination between a sex-specific locus, STS/STS pseudogene, and a pseudoautosomal locus, DXYS15, in younger men (age {$<$} or =30 years) compared with older men (age {$>$} or =50 years). A total of 2,329 sperm cells were typed by single-sperm PCR in 20 men who were heterozygous for the DXYS15 locus (1,014 sperm from 10 younger men and 1,315 sperm from 10 older men). The mean recombination frequency was 39.2\% in the younger men and 37.8\% in the older men. There was no heterogeneity in the frequency of recombination rates. There was no significant difference between the recombination frequencies among the younger men and those among the older men, when analyzed by the clustered binomial Z test (Z=.69, P=.49). This result suggests that paternal age has no effect on the recombination frequency in the pseudoautosomal region.},

Two partially redundant proteins, Rad54 and Tid1/Rdh54, act as recombinase accessory factors. Here, tetrad analysis shows that mutants lacking Tid1 form four-viable-spore tetrads with levels of interhomolog crossover (CO) and noncrossover recombination similar to, or slightly greater than, those in wild type. Importantly, tid1 mutants show a marked defect in crossover interference, a mechanism that distributes crossover events nonrandomly along chromosomes during meiosis. Previous work showed that dmc1Delta mutants are strongly defective in strand invasion and meiotic progression and that these defects can be partially suppressed by increasing the copy number of RAD54. Tetrad analysis is used to show that meiotic recombination in RAD54-suppressed dmc1Delta cells is similar to that in tid1; the frequency of COs and gene conversions is near normal, but crossover interference is defective. These results support the proposal that crossover interference acts at the strand invasion stage of recombination.},

  abstract = {Meiotic crossing-over is highly regulated such that each homolog pair typically receives at least one crossover (assurance) and adjacent crossovers are widely spaced (interference). Here we provide evidence that interference and assurance are mechanistically distinct processes that are separated by mutations in a new ZMM (Zip, Msh, Mer) protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Spo16. Like other zmm mutants, spo16 cells have defects in both crossing-over and synaptonemal complex formation. Unlike in previously characterized zmm mutants, the residual crossovers in spo16 cells show interference comparable to that in the wild type. Spo16 interacts with a second ZMM protein, Spo22 (also known as Zip4), and spo22 mutants also show normal interference. Notably, assembly of the MutS homologs Msh4 and Msh5 on chromosomes occurs in both spo16 and spo22, but not in other zmm mutants. We suggest that crossover interference requires the normal assembly of recombination complexes containing Msh4 and Msh5 but does not require Spo16- and Spo22-dependent extension of synaptonemal complexes. In contrast, crossover assurance requires all ZMM proteins and full-length synaptonemal complexes.},

Previous studies revealed no significant strain differences in nucleotide sequences around the hotspot, irrespective of the ability of the strain to enhance the recombination. It appeared that a distant genetic element might, therefore, control the rate of recombination. In the present study, original recombinants whose breakpoints were defined by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNAs were tested for the rate of secondary recombination in the crosses with laboratory strains in order to determine the location of such a genetic element. The results clearly demonstrated that the chromosomal segment proximal to the hotspot is essential for enhancement of recombination. Moreover, the male recombination is suppressed by a segment distal to the hotspot.},

In addition to this so-called class I CO pathway, a minority of crossovers are formed by a class II pathway, which involves the Mus81-Mms4 endonuclease complex. This is the only CO pathway in the SC-less meiosis of the fission yeast. ZMM proteins (including SC components) were always found to be co-occurring and hence have been regarded as functionally linked. Like the fission yeast, the protist Tetrahymena thermophila does not possess a SC, and its COs are dependent on Mus81-Mms4. Here we show that the ZMM proteins Msh4 and Msh5 are required for normal chiasma formation, and we propose that they have a pro-CO function outside a canonical class I pathway in Tetrahymena. Thus, the two-pathway model is not tenable as a general rule.},

Epigenetic mechanisms might be one additional factor affecting recombination. A biochemical approach to studying human germline methylation is difficult. We used the density of the 434,198 nonredundant methylation-associated SNPs (mSNPs) in the derived allele HapMap data set as a surrogate marker for germline DNA methylation. We validated our methodology by demonstrating that the mSNP density confirmed known patterns of genomic methylation, including the hypermutability of methylated cytosine and hypomethylation of CpG islands. Using this approach, we found a genome-wide positive correlation between germline methylation and regional recombination rate (500-kb windows: r = 0.622, P {$<$} 10(-15)). This remained significant with multiple correlations correcting for sequence features known to affect recombination, such as GC content and CpG dinucleotides (500-kb windows: r = 0.172, P {$<$} 10(-15)). Using the ENCODE data set for increased resolution, we found a positive correlation between germline DNA methylation and recombination rate (50-kb windows: r = 0.301, P = 0.002). This correlation was further strengthened when corrected for sequence features affecting recombination (50-kb windows: r = 0.445, P {$<$} 0.0001). In the Human Epigenome Project data set there was increased DNA methylation in regions within recombination hot spots in male germ cells (0.632 vs. 0.557, P = 0.007). The relationship we observed between germline DNA methylation and recombination could be explained in two ways that are not mutually exclusive: DNA methylation could indicate preferred sites for recombination, or methylation following recombination could inhibit further recombination, perhaps by being part of the enigmatic molecular pathway mediating crossover interference.},

Because of the explosive growth of methods for assessing genetic variation at a fine scale, evolutionary biologists and human geneticists are increasingly exploiting linkage disequilibrium in order to understand past evolutionary and demographic events, to map genes that are associated with quantitative characters and inherited diseases, and to understand the joint evolution of linked sets of genes. This article introduces linkage disequilibrium, reviews the population genetic processes that affect it and describes some of its uses. At present, linkage disequilibrium is used much more extensively in the study of humans than in non-humans, but that is changing as technological advances make extensive genomic studies feasible in other species.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination predominantly occurs at discrete genomic loci called recombination hotspots, but the features defining these areas are still largely unknown (reviewed in-). To enable a comprehensive analysis of hotspot-associated DNA and chromatin characteristics we developed a direct molecular approach for mapping meiotic DNA double stranded breaks that initiate recombination. Here, we present the genome-wide distribution of recombination initiation sites in the mouse genome, constituting the first physical map of recombination hotspots in a multi-cellular organism. Hotspot centres are mapped with approximately 200-nucleotide precision that enables analysis of the fine structural details of the preferred recombination sites. We determine that hotspots share a centrally distributed consensus motif, possess a nucleotide skew that changes polarity at the centre of hotspots, and have an intrinsic preference to be occupied by a nucleosome. Furthermore, we find that the vast majority of recombination initiation sites in mouse males are associated with testis-specific trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 that is distinct from histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation marks associated with transcription. The recombination map presented here has been derived from a homogeneous mouse population with a defined genetic background and therefore, lends itself to extensive future experimental exploration. Importantly, the mapping technique developed here does not depend on availability of genetic markers and hence can be easily adapted for other species with complex genomes. Our findings uncover several fundamental features of mammalian recombination hotspots and underline the power of the new recombination map for future studies of genetic recombination, genome stability and evolution.},

The authors generated a comprehensive panel of high-quality maps of recombination hot spots across major mouse subspecies and their hybrids and provide novel insights into how the action of PRDM9 and the evolutionary turnover of recombination hot spots alter the genome and lead to incompatibilities in hybrids., Meiotic recombination is required for the segregation of homologous chromosomes and is essential for fertility. In most mammals, the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination are directed to a subset of genomic loci (hot spots) by sequence-specific binding of the PRDM9 protein. Rapid evolution of the DNA-binding specificity of PRDM9 and gradual erosion of PRDM9-binding sites by gene conversion will alter the recombination landscape over time. To better understand the evolutionary turnover of recombination hot spots and its consequences, we mapped DSB hot spots in four major subspecies of Mus musculus with different Prdm9 alleles and in their F1 hybrids. We found that hot spot erosion governs the preferential usage of some Prdm9 alleles over others in hybrid mice and increases sequence diversity specifically at hot spots that become active in the hybrids. As crossovers are disfavored at such hot spots, we propose that sequence divergence generated by hot spot turnover may create an impediment for recombination in hybrids, potentially leading to reduced fertility and, eventually, speciation.},

Recent emphasis on the repair aspect of recombination has focused attention on DNA interactions and recombination near breaks. Here I review evidence for recombination far from DNA breaks in bacteria and fungi and discuss mechanisms by which this can occur. These mechanisms include entry of a traveling entity (``recombination machine'') at a break, formation of long heteroduplex DNA, priming of DNA replication by a broken end, and induction of recombination potential in trans. Special emphasis is placed on contrasting views of how the RecBCD enzyme of Escherichia coli promotes recombination far (tens of kb) from a double-strand break. The occurrence of recombination far from DNA breaks and of correlated recombination events far apart suggests that ``action at a distance'' during recombination is a widespread feature among diverse organisms.},

  abstract = {It has long been suspected that the rate of mutation varies across the human genome at a large scale based on the divergence between humans and other species. However, it is now possible to directly investigate this question using the large number of de novo mutations (DNMs) that have been discovered in humans through the sequencing of trios. We investigate a number of questions pertaining to the distribution of mutations using more than 130,000 DNMs from three large datasets. We demonstrate that the amount and pattern of variation differs between datasets at the 1MB and 100KB scales probably as a consequence of differences in sequencing technology and processing. In particular, datasets show different patterns of correlation to genomic variables such as replication time. Never-the-less there are many commonalities between datasets, which likely represent true patterns. We show that there is variation in the mutation rate at the 100KB, 1MB and 10MB scale that cannot be explained by variation at smaller scales, however the level of this variation is modest at large scales-at the 1MB scale we infer that \textasciitilde{}90\% of regions have a mutation rate within 50\% of the mean. Different types of mutation show similar levels of variation and appear to vary in concert which suggests the pattern of mutation is relatively constant across the genome. We demonstrate that variation in the mutation rate does not generate large-scale variation in GC-content, and hence that mutation bias does not maintain the isochore structure of the human genome. We find that genomic features explain less than 40\% of the explainable variance in the rate of DNM. As expected the rate of divergence between species is correlated to the rate of DNM. However, the correlations are weaker than expected if all the variation in divergence was due to variation in the mutation rate. We provide evidence that this is due the effect of biased gene conversion on the probability that a mutation will become fixed. In contrast to divergence, we find that most of the variation in diversity can be explained by variation in the mutation rate. Finally, we show that the correlation between divergence and DNM density declines as increasingly divergent species are considered.},

Here, we evaluate how and why conflicting patterns of recombination rate conservation and divergence may be observed, with particular emphasis on features that affect recombination, and the scale and method with which recombination is surveyed. Additionally, we review recent studies identifying features influencing fine-scale and broad-scale recombination patterns and informing how quickly recombination rates evolve, how changes in recombination impact selection and evolution in natural populations, and more broadly, which forces influence genome evolution.},

Despite considerable debate, it is not clear whether these factors are causally linked or, if they are, whether this is driven by the repeated action of adaptive evolution or molecular processes such as double-strand break formation and mismatch repair. We introduce three innovations to the analysis of recombination and diversity: fine-scale genetic maps estimated from genotype experiments that identify recombination hotspots at the kilobase scale, analysis of an entire human chromosome, and the use of wavelet techniques to identify correlations acting at different scales. We show that recombination influences genetic diversity only at the level of recombination hotspots. Hotspots are also associated with local increases in GC content and the relative frequency of GC-increasing mutations but have no effect on substitution rates. Broad-scale association between recombination and diversity is explained through covariance of both factors with base composition. To our knowledge, these results are the first evidence of a direct and local influence of recombination hotspots on genetic variation and the fate of individual mutations. However, that hotspots have no influence on substitution rates suggests that they are too ephemeral on an evolutionary time scale to have a strong influence on broader scale patterns of base composition and long-term molecular evolution.},

While the role of recombination in the evolution of sex has received theoretical and empirical attention, less is known about how recombination rate itself evolves and what influence this has on evolutionary processes within sexually reproducing organisms. Here, we explore the patterns of, and processes governing recombination in eukaryotes. We summarize patterns of variation, integrating current knowledge with an analysis of linkage map data in 353 organisms. We then discuss proximate and ultimate processes governing recombination rate variation and consider how these influence evolutionary processes. Genome-wide recombination rates (cM/Mb) can vary more than tenfold across eukaryotes, and there is large variation in the distribution of recombination events across closely related taxa, populations and individuals. We discuss how variation in rate and distribution relates to genome architecture, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, sex, environmental perturbations and variable selective pressures. There has been great progress in determining the molecular mechanisms governing recombination, and with the continued development of new modelling and empirical approaches, there is now also great opportunity to further our understanding of how and why recombination rate varies., This article is part of the themed issue `Evolutionary causes and consequences of recombination rate variation in sexual organisms'.},

The minimum sequence required for M26 activity was previously determined to be 5{${'}$}-ATGACGT-3{${'}$}. Originally identified by a mutant allele, ade6-M26, the M26 heptamer sequence occurs in the wild-type S. pombe genome approximately 300 times, but it has been unclear whether any of these are active hot spots. Recently, we showed that the M26 heptamer forms part of a larger consensus sequence, which is significantly more active than the heptamer alone. We used this expanded sequence as a guide to identify a smaller number of sites most likely to be active hot spots. Ten of the 15 sites tested showed meiotic DNA breaks, a hallmark of recombination hot spots, within 1 kb of the M26 sequence. Among those 10 sites, one occurred within a gene, cds1+, and hot spot activity of this site was confirmed genetically. These results are, to our knowledge, the first demonstration in any organism of a simple, defined nucleotide sequence accurately predicting the locations of natural meiotic recombination hot spots. M26 may be the first example among a diverse group of simple sequences that determine the distribution, and hence predictability, of meiotic recombination hot spots in eukaryotic genomes.},

This locus encodes a meiosis-specific histone H3 methyltransferase that specifies meiotic recombination hotspots during gametogenesis. Allelic differences in Prdm9, characterized for a variable number of zinc finger (ZF) domains, have been associated with hybrid sterility in male house mice via spermatogenic failure at the pachytene stage. The mule, a classic example of hybrid sterility in mammals also exhibits a similar spermatogenesis breakdown, making Prdm9 an interesting candidate to evaluate in equine hybrids. In this study, we characterized the Prdm9 gene in all species of equids by analyzing sequence variation of the ZF domains and estimating positive selection. We also evaluated the role of Prdm9 in hybrid sterility by assessing allelic differences of ZF domains in equine hybrids. We found remarkable variation in the sequence and number of ZF domains among equid species, ranging from five domains in the Tibetan kiang and Asiatic wild ass, to 14 in the Grevy's zebra. Positive selection was detected in all species at amino acid sites known to be associated with DNA-binding specificity of ZF domains in mice and humans. Equine hybrids, in particular a quartet pedigree composed of a fertile mule showed a mosaic of sequences and number of ZF domains suggesting that Prdm9 variation does not seem by itself to contribute to equine hybrid sterility.},

Great ape genetic diversity and population history. Nature 499:471-475). We also identified species-specific recombination hotspots in each group using a modified LDhot framework, which greatly improves statistical power to detect hotspots at varying strengths. We show that fewer hotspots are shared among chimpanzee subspecies than within human populations, further narrowing the time scale of complete hotspot turnover. Further, using species-specific PRDM9 sequences to predict potential binding sites (PBS), we show higher predicted PRDM9 binding in recombination hotspots as compared to matched cold spot regions in multiple great ape species, including at least one chimpanzee subspecies. We found that correlations between broad-scale recombination rates decline more rapidly than nucleotide divergence between species. We also compared the skew of recombination rates at centromeres and telomeres between species and show a skew from chromosome means extending as far as 10-15 Mb from chromosome ends. Further, we examined broad-scale recombination rate changes near a translocation in gorillas and found minimal differences as compared to other great ape species perhaps because the coordinates relative to the chromosome ends were unaffected. Finally, on the basis of multiple linear regression analysis, we found that various correlates of recombination rate persist throughout the African great apes including repeats, diversity, and divergence.

               One effect of recombination is to determine the extent of linkage disequilibrium in population DNA samples.  Direct measurement of the recombination rate is difficult and often impractical. For this reason, population-genetic methods are often used to infer recombination rates from patterns of variation among DNA sequences.  Population-genetic methods can detect variation in the recombination rate at the level of single genes.  Although simple parsimony methods allow the number of recombination events to be counted, most recombination events are missed using this approach.  Sophisticated statistical approaches use population-genetic models to estimate recombination rates.  Several statistical methods that estimate the population recombination rate have been developed. These are influenced by population history, but can provide important insights into details of the recombination process.  Biologically important inferences can be drawn from these estimators even if the underlying assumptions are oversimplified.  Discrepancies between estimated and experimentally measured rates can reveal important biological processes.  Estimated recombination rates enable the detailed interpretation of linkage disequilibrium and haplotype data.},

Little is known about patterns of meiotic recombination in human germ cells or the mechanisms that control these patterns. Here, newly developed immunofluorescence techniques, based on the detection of MLH1 (a DNA mismatch repair protein) foci on synaptonemal complexes (SCs) at prophase I of meiosis, were used to examine recombination in human spermatocytes. The mean number of MLH1 foci per cell in all donors was 48.0 with range from 21 to 65. Remarkable variation in the recombination frequency was noted among 11 normal individuals: the mean frequencies of chromosomal recombination foci ranged from a low of 42.5 to a high of 55.0 exchanges. Donor age did not contribute to this variation. There was no correlation between this variation and the frequency of gaps (discontinuities) or splits (unpaired chromosome regions) in the SCs. The mean percentage of cells with gaps was 35\% (range: 20\% to 58\%) and with splits was 7\% (range: 0\% to 37\%). Bivalents without a recombination focus were rare, with a frequency of only 0.3\%. Thus, achiasmate chromosomes appear to be rare in human male meiosis.},

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is of current interest for its application in whole genome association mapping, since the extent of LD determines the feasibility of such studies. We have measured LD at five genomic intervals, each 5 Mb in length and composed of five clusters of sequence variants spaced 800 kb-1.6 Mb apart. These intervals are located on canine chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 34, and 37, and none is under obvious selective pressure. Approximately 20 unrelated dogs were assayed from each of five breeds: Akita, Bernese Mountain Dog, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, and Pekingese. At each genomic interval, SNPs and indels were discovered and typed by resequencing. Strikingly, LD in canines is much more extensive than in humans: D' falls to 0.5 at 400-700 kb in Golden Retriever and Labrador Retriever, 2.4 Mb in Akita, and 3-3.2 Mb in Bernese Mountain Dog and Pekingese. LD in dog breeds is up to 100x more extensive than in humans, suggesting that a correspondingly smaller number of markers will be required for association mapping studies in dogs compared to humans. We also report low haplotype diversity within regions of high LD, with 80\% of chromosomes in a breed carrying two to four haplotypes, as well as a high degree of haplotype sharing among breeds.},

Recombination is measured in morgans (w) over a single generation in a linkage map but may cover thousands of generations in a linkage disequilibrium (LD) map measured in LD units (LDU). We used a subset of single nucleotide polymorphisms from the HapMap Project to create a genome-wide map in LDU. Recombination accounts for 96.8\% of the LDU variance in chromosome arms and 92.4\% in their deciles. However, deeper analysis shows that LDU/w, an estimate of the effective bottleneck time (t), is significantly variable among chromosome arms because (i) the linkage map is approximated from the Haldane function, then adjusted toward the Kosambi function that is more accurate but still exaggerates w for all chromosomes, especially shorter ones; (ii) the nonpseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome is subject to hemizygous selection; and (iii) at resolution less than {$\approx$}40,000 markers per w, there are indeterminacies (holes) in the LD map reflecting intervals of very high recombination. Selection and stochastic variation in small regions must have effects, which remain to be investigated by comparisons among populations. These considerations suggest an optimal strategy to eliminate holes quickly, greatly enhance the resolution of sex-specific linkage maps, and maximize the gain in association mapping by using LD maps.},

  abstract = {Meiotic chromosomes in human oocytes are packaged differently than in spermatocytes at the pachytene stage of meiosis I, when crossing-over takes place. Thus the meiosis-specific pairing structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC), is considerably longer in oocytes in comparison to spermatocytes. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of this length factor on meiotic recombination in male and female human germ cells. The positions of crossovers were identified by the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1. Spermatocytes have approximately 50 crossovers per cell in comparison to more than 70 in oocytes. Analyses of inter-crossover distances (and presumptively crossover interference) along SCs suggested that while there might be inter-individual variation, there was no consistent difference between sexes. Thus the higher rate of recombination in human oocytes is not a consequence of more closely spaced crossovers along the SCs. The rate of recombination per unit length of SC is higher in spermatocytes than oocytes. However, when the so-called obligate chiasma is excluded from the analysis, then the rates of recombination per unit length of SC are essentially identical in the two sexes. Our analyses indicate that the inter-sex difference in recombination is largely a consequence of the difference in meiotic chromosome architecture in the two sexes. We propose that SC length per se, and therefore the size of the physical platform for crossing-over (and not the DNA content) is the principal factor determining the difference in rate of recombination in male and female germ cells. A preliminary investigation of SC loop size by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated loops may be shorter in oocytes than in spermatocytes.},

Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95\% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10(-8) per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next phase of human genetic research.},

It occurs predominantly at recombination hotspots that are defined by the DNA binding specificity of the PRDM9 protein. PRDM9 contains three conserved domains typically involved in regulation of transcription; yet, the role of PRDM9 in gene expression control is not clear. Here, we analyze the germline transcriptome of Prdm9-/- male mice in comparison to Prdm9+/+ males and find no apparent differences in the mRNA and miRNA profiles. We further explore the role of PRDM9 in meiosis by analyzing the effect of the KRAB, SSXRD, and post-SET zinc finger deletions in a cell culture expression system and the KRAB domain deletion in mice. We found that although the post-SET zinc finger and the KRAB domains are not essential for the methyltransferase activity of PRDM9 in cell culture, the KRAB domain mutant mice show only residual PRDM9 methyltransferase activity and undergo meiotic arrest. In aggregate, our data indicate that domains typically involved in regulation of gene expression do not serve that role in PRDM9, but are likely involved in setting the proper chromatin environment for initiation and completion of homologous recombination.},

  abstract = {Recent work indicates that allelic incompatibility in the mouse PRDM9 (Meisetz) gene can cause hybrid male sterility, contributing to genetic isolation and potentially speciation. The only phenotype of mouse PRDM9 knockouts is a meiosis I block that causes sterility in both sexes. The PRDM9 gene encodes a protein with histone H3(K4) trimethyltransferase activity, a KRAB domain, and a DNA-binding domain consisting of multiple tandem C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) domains. We have analyzed human coding polymorphism and interspecies evolutionary changes in the PRDM9 gene. The ZF domains of PRDM9 are evolving very rapidly, with compelling evidence of positive selection in primates. Positively selected amino acids are predominantly those known to make nucleotide specific contacts in C2H2 zinc fingers. These results suggest that PRDM9 is subject to recurrent selection to change DNA-binding specificity. The human PRDM9 protein is highly polymorphic in its ZF domains and nearly all polymorphisms affect the same nucleotide contact residues that are subject to positive selection. ZF domain nucleotide sequences are strongly homogenized within species, indicating that interfinger recombination contributes to their evolution. PRDM9 has previously been assumed to be a transcription factor required to induce meiosis specific genes, a role that is inconsistent with its molecular evolution. We suggest instead that PRDM9 is involved in some aspect of centromere segregation conflict and that rapidly evolving centromeric DNA drives changes in PRDM9 DNA-binding domains.},

In that case, only a small fraction of each gene would code for the ultimate gene product, the remainder being `spacer' DNA with still ill-defined functions. The sequence coding for the gene product will be hereafter designated as the structural gene. The complex organisation of chromatine in higher organisms raises the problem of its possible influence on the distribution of recombination events.

Recent sperm typing studies provided data at very high resolution and accuracy that defined the physical limits of a number of hot spots. The data were also used to test whether patterns of LD can predict hot spot locations. These sperm typing studies focused on several small regions of the genome already known or suspected of containing a hot spot based on the presence of LD breakdown or previous experimental evidence of hot spot activity. Comparable data on target regions not specifically chosen using these two criteria is lacking but is needed to make an unbiased test of whether LD data alone can accurately predict active hot spots. We used sperm typing to estimate recombination in 17 almost contiguous \textasciitilde{}5 kb intervals spanning 103 kb of human Chromosome 21. We found two intervals that contained new hot spots. The comparison of our data with recombination rates predicted by statistical analyses of LD showed that, overall, the two datasets corresponded well, except for one predicted hot spot that showed little crossing over. This study doubles the experimental data on recombination in men at the highest resolution and accuracy and supports the emerging genome-wide picture that recombination is localized in small regions separated by cold areas. Detailed study of one of the new hot spots revealed a sperm donor with a decrease in recombination intensity at the canonical recombination site but an increase in crossover activity nearby. This unique finding suggests that the position and intensity of hot spots may evolve by means of a concerted mechanism that maintains the overall recombination intensity in the region.},

  abstract = {Meiosis is initiated by a double-strand break (DSB) introduced in the DNA by a highly controlled process that is repaired by recombination. In many organisms, recombination occurs at specific and narrow regions of the genome, known as recombination hotspots, which overlap with regions enriched for DSBs. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that conversions and mutations resulting from the repair of DSBs lead to a rapid sequence evolution at recombination hotspots eroding target sites for DSBs. We still do not fully understand the effect of this erosion in the recombination activity, but evidence has shown that the binding of trans-acting factors like PRDM9 is affected. PRDM9 is a meiosis-specific, multi-domain protein that recognizes DNA target motifs by its zinc finger domain and directs DSBs to these target sites. Here we discuss the changes in affinity of PRDM9 to eroded recognition sequences, and explain how these changes in affinity of PRDM9 can affect recombination, leading sometimes to sterility in the context of hybrid crosses. We also present experimental data showing that DNA methylation reduces PRDM9 binding in vitro. Finally, we discuss PRDM9-independent hotspots, posing the question how these hotspots evolve and change with sequence erosion., This article is part of the themed issue `Evolutionary causes and consequences of recombination rate variation in sexual organisms'.},

  abstract = {Most cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the inherited inability to synthesize cortisol, are caused by mutations in the steroid 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21). Steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency is unusual among genetic diseases in that approximately 95\% of the mutant alleles have apparently been generated by recombination between a normally active gene (CYP21) and a linked pseudogene (CYP21P). Approximately 20\% of mutant alleles carry DNA deletions of 30 kb that have presumably been generated by unequal meiotic crossing-over, whereas 75\% carry one or more mutations in CYP21 that are normally found in the CYP21P pseudogene. These latter mutations are termed "gene conversions," although the mechanism by which they are generated is not well understood. To assess the frequency at which these different recombination events occur, we have used PCR to detect de novo deletions and gene conversions in matched sperm and peripheral blood leukocyte DNA samples from normal individuals. Deletions with breakpoints in a 100-bp region in intron 2 and exon 3 were detected in sperm DNA samples with frequencies of approximately 1 in 10(5)-10(6) genomes but were never detected in the matching leukocyte DNA. Gene conversions in the same region occur in approximately 1 in 10(3)-10(5) genomes in both sperm and leukocyte DNA. These data suggest that whereas deletions occur exclusively in meiosis, gene conversions occur during both meiosis and mitosis, or perhaps only during mitosis. Thus, gene conversions must occur by a mechanism distinct from unequal crossing-over.},

  abstract = {Recombination hotspots are small chromosomal regions, where meiotic crossover events happen with high frequency. Recombination is initiated by a double-strand break (DSB) that requires the intervention of the molecular repair mechanism. The DSB repair mechanism may result in the exchange of homologous chromosomes (crossover) and the conversion of the allelic sequence that breaks into the one that does not break (biased gene conversion). Biased gene conversion results in a transmission advantage for the allele that does not break, thus preventing recombination and rendering recombination hotspots transient. How is it possible that recombination hotspots persist over evolutionary time (maintaining the average chromosomal crossover rate) when they are self-destructive? This fundamental question is known as the recombination hotspot paradox and has attracted much attention in recent years. Yet, that attention has not translated into a fully satisfactory answer. No existing model adequately explains all aspects of the recombination hotspot paradox. Here, we formulate an intragenomic conflict model resulting in Red Queen dynamics that fully accounts for all empirical observations regarding the molecular mechanisms of recombination hotspots, the nonrandom targeting of the recombination machinery to hotspots and the evolutionary dynamics of hotspot turnover.},

  author = {Venn, Oliver Claude},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {In eukaryotes, recombination plays a critical role in both the production of viable gametes and as a population genetic process. Here, we are interested in studying recombination as it provides insight into a process that has shaped variation. To this end, we study the evolution of cross-over rates in chimpanzees and humans through two experiments. Components of the recombination machinery are well described in yeast and C. elegans, but less so in other species. In humans, cross-over rates vary across physical scales and occur predominantly in narrow {$\sim$}2 kb regions called hotspots, where hotspot usage differs considerably between individuals. Differential hotspot usage is associated with specific DNA motifs, and DNA-contacting zinc finger array variants in the transacting PRDM9 H3K4 trimethyltransferase. The precise relationship between DNA motifs, PRDM9 and hotspot activity is not completely understood. Experiment 1. To investigate the importance of PRDM9 motif recognition, which is predicted be different between humans and chimpanzees, and the effect of PRDM9 on the evolution of fine-scale cross-over rates, we sequenced 10 unrelated Pan troglodytes verus (Western chimpanzee) genomes to moderate coverage ({$\sim$}10\texttimes{}). I validate the approach by demonstrating that fine-scale maps estimated from 10 human genomes of each African and European ancestry recapitulate independently estimated maps. Then I characterise the error modes in sequencing data arising from errors in chemistry, alignment, variant calling, and genotyping. I identify several cryptic error modes missed by state-of-the-art filters and develop methods to counteract them. To guard against genotype error arising from stochastic variation in low to moderate coverage sequencing, I develop methods to incorporate the underlying statistical uncertainty into recombination analyses, evaluate the approaches through simulation (estimated 11\% improvement) and empirical assessment (estimated 4\% improvement), and discover that the reported genotype uncertainty is poorly calibrated, which limits the approaches. Consequently, a filtering approach was applied to the hard-called chimpanzee genotypes. I estimate recombination rates in chimpanzees through an existing LD-based method. In contrast to humans, there is no increased cross-over localisation around chimpanzee PRDM9 binding predictions, nor motifs consistently associated with activity. Hotspots do not overlap between the two species, indicating that rates evolved rapidly and consistent with PRDM9 localising all hotspots. In contrast, gene pro- moters and CpG islands are common attractors of recombination (2.7-fold increase in rate in chimpanzee, 1.5-fold increase in human), suggesting chromatin state influences hotspot placement but to varying degree in the species. I discuss the potential implications for PRDM9 mechanism. Experiment 2. To enable a more representative characterisation of the spectrum of genome changes occurring in chimpanzee genomes, I analyse data from an extended three generation Western chimpanzee pedigree sequenced at high coverage ({$\sim$}30\texttimes{}). I use Mendel transmission to filter variants, infer haplotypes, and identify recombination events through a Hidden Markov Model approach. We detect 375 recombination events, of which 3 are double cross-over events. Sex-specific recombination rate estimates in chimpanzees mirror sex differences in humans (N\male/N\venus{} = 0.58) and have similar levels of total recombination. We resolve recombination events typically at {$\sim$} 856 base-pair resolution. Additionally, analyses of Mendel inconsistencies suggest that extended pedigree sequencing opens the door on studying complex genome changes. These experiments demonstrate the power of comparative analyses, the utility of high throughput sequencing in enabling the study of recombination in almost any species of interest, the challenges in sifting signal from noise in these data, and the need for experimental and algorithmic methods to guard against error.},

Maternal and unlinked genomic markers, however, might underestimate the extent of introgressive hybridization, and their impacts on the preservation of wild wolf gene pools. In this study, we genotyped 220 presumed Italian wolves, 85 dogs and 7 known hybrids at 16 microsatellites belonging to four different linkage groups (plus four unlinked microsatellites). Population clustering and individual assignments were performed using a Bayesian procedure implemented in structure 2.1, which models the gametic disequilibrium arising between linked loci during admixtures, aiming to trace hybridization events further back in time and infer the population of origin of chromosomal blocks. Results indicate that (i) linkage disequilibrium was higher in wolves than in dogs; (ii) 11 out of 220 wolves (5.0\%) were likely admixed, a proportion that is significantly higher than one admixed genotype in 107 wolves found previously in a study using unlinked markers; (iii) posterior maximum-likelihood estimates of the recombination parameter r revealed that introgression in Italian wolves is not recent, but could have continued for the last 70 ({$\pm$} 20) generations, corresponding to approximately 140\textendash{}210 years. Bayesian clustering showed that, despite some admixture, wolf and dog gene pools remain sharply distinct (the average proportions of membership to wolf and dog clusters were Qw = 0.95 and Qd = 0.98, respectively), suggesting that hybridization was not frequent, and that introgression in nature is counteracted by behavioural or selective constraints.},

These hypotheses were themselves grounded in Morgan's defense of the chromosome theory of heredity, according to which chromosomes are the physical basis of genes. In this paper, I analyze the 1919 debate between William Castle and Morgan's group, about the construction of genetic maps. The official issue of the debate concerns the arrangement of genes on chromosomes. However, the disputants tend to carry out the discussions about how one should model the data in order to draw predictions concerning the transmission of genes; the debate does not bear on the data themselves, nor does it focus on the hypotheses explaining these data. The main criteria that are appealed to by the protagonists are simplicity and predictive efficacy. However, I show that both parties' assessments of the simplicity and predictive efficacy of different ways of modeling the data themselves depend on background theoretical positions. I aim at clarifying how preference for a given model and theoretical commitments articulate.},

After the DNA sequence-dependent activation of hotspots was discovered in fission yeast, nearly two decades elapsed before the key realizations that (A) DNA site-dependent regulation is broadly conserved and (B) individual eukaryotes have multiple different DNA sequence motifs that activate hotspots. From our perspective, such findings provide a conceptually straightforward solution to the hotspot paradox and can explain other, seemingly complex features of meiotic recombination. We describe how a small number of single-base-pair substitutions can generate hotspots de novo and dramatically alter their distribution in the genome. This model also shows how equilibrium rate kinetics could maintain the presence of hotspots over evolutionary timescales, without strong selective pressures invoked previously, and explains why hotspots localize preferentially to intergenic regions and introns. The model is robust enough to account for all hotspots of humans and chimpanzees repositioned since their divergence from the latest common ancestor.},

To shed light on these questions, we performed a high-resolution analysis of a genomic region within the beta-globin gene cluster that is known to experience elevated recombination rates in humans. For this purpose, we developed new linkage disequilibrium-based methods that thoroughly search for subsets of the data with unusually high or unusually low estimated values of the population-recombination parameter (4Nr, where N is the effective population size and r is the crossover rate between adjacent base pairs). By resequencing a 15-kb segment in a human population sample, we were able to narrow the recombinational hotspot to a segment {$<$}2 kb in length that coincides with the beta-globin replication origin. In addition, we analyzed the orthologous region in samples of rhesus macaques and common chimpanzees. Whereas the analysis of the chimpanzee data is complicated by the sample structure, the macaque data imply that this region may not be a hotspot in that species. These results suggest a time scale for the evolution of hotspots in primates. Furthermore, they allow us to propose diverged sequence elements that may contribute to the differences in the recombinational landscape in the two species.},

A microfluidic system was used for highly parallel sample processing and to minimize nonspecific amplification. High-density genotyping results from 91 single cells were used to create a personal recombination map, which was consistent with population-wide data at low resolution but revealed significant differences from pedigree data at higher resolution. We used the data to test for meiotic drive and found evidence for gene conversion. High-throughput sequencing on 31 single cells was used to measure the frequency of large-scale genome instability, and deeper sequencing of eight single cells revealed de novo mutation rates with distinct characteristics.},

  abstract = {Population diversity data have recently provided profound, albeit inferential, insights into meiotic recombination across the human genome, revealing a landscape dominated by thousands of cross-over hotspots. However, very few of these putative hotspots have been directly analyzed for cross-over activity. We now describe a search for very active hotspots, by using extreme breakdown of marker association as a guide for high-resolution sperm cross-over analysis. This strategy has led to the isolation of the most active cross-over hotspots yet described. Their morphology, sequence attributes, and cross-over processes are very similar to those seen at less active hotspots, but their activity in sperm is poorly predicted from population diversity information. Several of these hotspots showed evidence for biased gene conversion accompanying cross-over, in some cases associated with variation between men in cross-over activity and with two hotspots showing complete presence/absence polymorphism in different men. Hotspot polymorphism is very common at less active hotspots but curiously was not seen at any of the most active hotspots. This contrasts with the prediction that extreme hotspots should be the most vulnerable to attenuation by meiotic drive in favor of mutations that suppress recombination and should therefore show rapid rate evolution and thus variation in activity between men. Finally, these very intense hotspots provide a valuable resource for dissecting meiotic recombination processes and pathways in humans.},

Two allele-specific oligonucleotide primers, one specific for the sickle cell allele and one specific for the normal allele, together with another primer complementary to both alleles were used in the polymerase chain reaction with genomic DNA templates. The allele-specific primers differed from each other in their terminal 3' nucleotide. Under the proper annealing temperature and polymerase chain reaction conditions, these primers only directed amplification on their complementary allele. In a single blind study of DNA samples from 12 individuals, this method correctly and unambiguously allowed for the determination of the genotypes with no false negatives or positives. If ASPCR is able to discriminate all allelic variation (both transition and transversion mutations), this method has the potential to be a powerful approach for genetic disease diagnosis, carrier screening, HLA typing, human gene mapping, forensics, and paternity testing.},

DSBs occur at sites that are hypersensitive in nuclease digests of chromatin, suggesting a role for chromatin structure in determining DSB location. We show here that the frequency of DSBs at a site is not determined simply by DNA sequence or by features of chromatin structure. An arg4-containing plasmid was inserted at several different locations in the yeast genome. Meiosis-induced DSBs occurred at similar sites in pBR322-derived portions of the construct at all insert loci, and the frequency of these breaks varied in a manner that mirrored the frequency of meiotic recombination in the arg4 portion of the insert. However, DSBs did not occur in the insert-borne arg4 gene at a site that is frequently broken at the normal ARG4 locus, even though the insert-borne arg4 gene and the normal ARG4 locus displayed similar DNase I hypersensitivity patterns. Deletions that removed active DSB sites from an insert at HIS4 restored breaks to the insert-borne arg4 gene and to a DSB site in flanking chromosomal sequences. We conclude that the frequency of DSB at a site can be affected by sequences several thousands nucleotides away and suggest that this is because of competition between DSB sites for locally limited factors.},

Here, we expand on recent studies of nucleotide-resolution DSB maps in mouse spermatocytes. We find that trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 36 around DSB hotspots is highly correlated, both spatially and quantitatively, with trimethylation of H3 lysine 4, consistent with coordinated formation and action of both PRDM9-dependent histone modifications. In contrast, the DSB-responsive kinase ATM contributes independently of PRDM9 to controlling hotspot activity, and combined action of ATM and PRDM9 can explain nearly two-thirds of the variation in DSB frequency between hotspots. DSBs were modestly underrepresented in most repetitive sequences such as segmental duplications and transposons. Nonetheless, numerous DSBs form within repetitive sequences in each meiosis and some classes of repeats are preferentially targeted. Implications of these findings are discussed for evolution of PRDM9 and its role in hybrid strain sterility in mice. Finally, we document the relationship between mouse strain-specific DNA sequence variants within PRDM9 recognition motifs and attendant differences in recombination outcomes. Our results provide further insights into the complex web of factors that influence meiotic recombination patterns.},

Partial sequence analysis of two haplotypes has revealed many single nucleotide polymorphisms and InDel polymorphisms, including several large structural polymorphisms.

Two of these recombination hot spots are genic (a1 and yz1) and one is apparently nongenic. The x1 gene is not a recombination hot spot. Thus, these results suggest that not all hot spots are genes and indicate that not all genes are hot spots. Two of the 101 recombination events arose by means of either noncrossover events involving conversion tract lengths of at least 17 kb or double-crossover events. Only one recombination breakpoint mapped to the {$\approx$}80-kb distal portion of the a1-sh2 interval that contains large amounts of repetitive DNA including retrotransposons; in this region the ratio of genetic to physical distance is less than 0.5\% of the genome's average.

These foci represent sites of eventual concentration of other conserved CO proteins that initially exhibit broader distribution. Chromosomes gain and lose competence to load CO proteins at DSBs during meiotic progression, with competence to load COSA-1 requiring a prior licensing event. Our data further suggest a self-reinforcing mechanism maintaining CO designation. Modeling of a non-linear dose-response relationship between IR-induced DSBs and COSA-1 foci reveals efficient conversion of DSBs into COs when DSBs are limiting, and a robust capacity to limit the number of cytologically-differentiated CO sites when DSBs are in excess. COSA-1 foci serve as a biodosimeter for DSB levels and a unique live-cell readout of CO interference.},

Meiotic crossovers are essential for ensuring correct chromosome segregation as well as for creating new combinations of alleles for natural selection to take place. During meiosis, excess meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated; a subset of these breaks are repaired to form crossovers, whereas the remainder are repaired as non-crossovers. What determines where meiotic DSBs are created and whether a crossover or non-crossover will be formed at any particular DSB remains largely unclear. Nevertheless, several recent papers have revealed important insights into the factors that control the decision between crossover and non-crossover formation in meiosis, including DNA elements that determine the positioning of meiotic DSBs, and the generation and processing of recombination intermediates. In this review, we focus on the factors that influence DSB positioning, the proteins required for the formation of recombination intermediates and how the processing of these structures generates either a crossover or non-crossover in various organisms. A discussion of crossover interference, assurance and homeostasis, which influence crossing over on a chromosome-wide and genome-wide scale \textendash{} in addition to current models for the generation of interference \textendash{} is also included. This Commentary aims to highlight recent advances in our understanding of the factors that promote or prevent meiotic crossing over.},

We provide four lines of evidence suggesting that it regulates the formation and distribution of crossover events required to promote chromosome segregation at Meiosis I. First, pch2Delta mutants display wild-type crossover levels on a small (III) chromosome, but increased levels on larger (VII, VIII, XV) chromosomes. Second, pch2Delta mutants show defects in crossover interference. Third, crossovers observed in pch2Delta require both Msh4-Msh5 and Mms4-Mus81 functions. Lastly, the pch2Delta mutation decreases spore viability and disrupts crossover interference in spo11 hypomorph strains that have reduced levels of meiosis-induced double-strand breaks. Based on these and previous observations, we propose a model in which Pch2 functions at an early step in crossover control to ensure that every homolog pair receives an obligate crossover.},

  abstract = {Crossing-over is a central feature of meiosis. Meiotic crossover (CO) sites are spatially patterned along chromosomes. CO-designation at one position disfavors subsequent CO-designation(s) nearby, as described by the classical phenomenon of CO interference. If multiple designations occur, COs tend to be evenly spaced. We have previously proposed a mechanical model by which CO patterning could occur. The central feature of a mechanical mechanism is that communication along the chromosomes, as required for CO interference, can occur by redistribution of mechanical stress. Here we further explore the nature of the beam-film model, its ability to quantitatively explain CO patterns in detail in several organisms, and its implications for three important patterning-related phenomena: CO homeostasis, the fact that the level of zero-CO bivalents can be low (the ``obligatory CO''), and the occurrence of non-interfering COs. Relationships to other models are discussed., Spatial patterning is a common feature of biological systems at all length scales, from molecular to multi-organismic. Meiosis is the specialized cellular program in which a diploid cell gives rise to haploid gametes for sexual reproduction. Crossing-over between homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes (homologs) is a central feature of this program, playing a role not only for increasing genetic diversity but also for ensuring regular segregation of homologs at the first meiotic division. The distribution of crossovers (COs) along meiotic chromosomes is a paradigmatic example of spatial patterning. Crossovers occur at different positions in different meiotic nuclei but, nonetheless, tend to be evenly spaced along the chromosomes. We previously-described a mechanical ``stress and stress relief'' model for CO patterning with an accompanying mathematical description (the ``beam-film model''). In this paper we explore the roles of mathematical parameters in this model; show that it can very accurately describe experimental data sets from several organisms, in considerably quantitative depth; and discuss implications of the model for several phenomena that are directly related to crossover patterning, including the features which can ensure that every chromosome always acquires at least one crossover.},
