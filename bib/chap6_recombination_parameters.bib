  abstract = {The recent mapping of recombination hot spots in the human genome has demonstrated that crossover is a nonrandom process that occurs at well-defined positions along chromosomes. However, the mechanisms that direct hot-spot turnover in complex mammalian genomes are poorly understood. Analyses of the human genome are impaired by the inability to genetically dissect and molecularly manipulate recombinogenic regions to test their roles in regulating hot spots. Here, using the BXD recombinant inbred strains as a crossover library, three new recombination hot spots have been identified on mouse chromosome 19. Analyses of a highly polymorphic recombination hot spot (HS22) revealed that approximately 4\% of recombinant molecules display complex and incomplete repair with discontinuous conversion tracts, as well as persistent heteroduplex DNA at crossover sites in mature spermatozoa. Also, sequence analysis of the wild house mouse revealed instability at the center of this hot spot. This suggests that complete repair is not required for completion of mammalian meiosis, a scenario that leaves duplex DNA containing mismatches at crossover sites.},

  abstract = {In mammalian meiosis, only a small fraction of programmed DNA double-strand breaks are repaired as inter-homolog crossovers (COs). To analyze another product of meiotic recombination, inter-homolog noncrossovers (NCOs), we performed high-resolution mapping of recombination events at an intensely active mouse hotspot in F1 hybrids derived from inbred mouse strains. We provide direct evidence that the vast majority of repair events are inter-homolog NCOs, consistent with models in which frequent inter-homolog interactions promote accurate chromosome pairing. NCOs peaked at the center of the hotspot, but were also broadly distributed throughout. In some hybrid strains, localized zones within the hotspot were highly refractory to COs and showed elevated frequency of co-conversion of adjacent polymorphisms in NCOs, raising the possibility of double-strand gap repair. Transmission distortion was observed in one hybrid, with NCOs providing a significant contribution. Thus, NCO recombination events play a substantial role in mammalian meiosis and genome evolution.},

  abstract = {Understanding the forces that influence natural variation within and among populations has been a major objective of evolutionary biologists for decades. Motivated by the growth in computational power and data complexity, modern approaches to this question make intensive use of simulation methods. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is one of these methods. Here we review the foundations of ABC, its recent algorithmic developments, and its applications in evolutionary biology and ecology. We argue that the use of ABC should incorporate all aspects of Bayesian data analysis: formulation, fitting, and improvement of a model. ABC can be a powerful tool to make inferences with complex models if these principles are carefully applied.},

  abstract = {1. Many recent statistical applications involve inference under complex models, where it is computationally prohibitive to calculate likelihoods but possible to simulate data. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is devoted to these complex models because it bypasses the evaluation of the likelihood function by comparing observed and simulated data. 2. We introduce the R package `abc' that implements several ABC algorithms for performing parameter estimation and model selection. In particular, the recently developed nonlinear heteroscedastic regression methods for ABC are implemented. The `abc' package also includes a cross-validation tool for measuring the accuracy of ABC estimates and to calculate the misclassification probabilities when performing model selection. The main functions are accompanied by appropriate summary and plotting tools. 3. R is already widely used in bioinformatics and several fields of biology. The R package `abc' will make the ABC algorithms available to a large number of R users. `abc' is a freely available R package under the GPL license, and it can be downloaded at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abc/index.html.},

  abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},
