  abstract = {Recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have unveiled that meiotic recombination crossovers are formed by two genetically distinct pathways: a major interference-sensitive pathway and a minor interference-insensitive pathway. Several proteins, including the MSH4/MSH5 heterodimer and the MER3 DNA helicase, are indispensable for the interference-sensitive pathway. MSH4 homologs have been identified in mice and Arabidopsis and shown to be required for normal levels of crossovers, suggesting that the function of MSH4 may be conserved among major eukaryotic kingdoms. However, it is not known whether an MER3-like function is also required for meiosis in animals and plants. We have identified an Arabidopsis gene that encodes a putative MER3 homolog and is preferentially expressed in meiocytes. T-DNA insertional mutants of this gene exhibit defects in fertility and meiosis. Detailed cytological studies indicate that the mutants are defective in homolog synapsis and crossover formation, resulting in a reduction of bivalents and in the formation of univalents at late prophase I. We have named this gene ROCK-N-ROLLERS (RCK) to reflect the mutant phenotype of chromosomes undergoing the meiotic `dance' either in pairs or individually. Our results demonstrate that an MER3-like function is required for meiotic crossover in plants and provide further support for the idea that Arabidopsis, like the budding yeast, possesses both interference-sensitive and insensitive pathways for crossover formation.},

Here, we report the construction and initial characterization of a genome-wide panel of congenic strains derived from the donor strain DBA/2J on the background strain C57BL/6J. For many strains, we have carried out high-density SNP genotyping to precisely map the congenic interval and to identify any contaminating regions. Certain strains exhibit striking variation in litter size and in the ratio of females to males. We illustrate the utility of the set by ``Mendelizing'' the complex trait of myocardial calcification. These 65 strains cover more than 95\% of the autosomal genome and should facilitate the analysis of the many genetic trait differences that have been reported between these parental strains.},

  abstract = {Gene conversions resulting from meiotic recombination are critical in shaping genome diversification and evolution. How the extent of gene conversions is regulated is unknown. Here we show that the budding yeast mismatch repair related MutL{$\beta$} complex, Mlh1-Mlh2, specifically interacts with the conserved meiotic Mer3 helicase, which recruits it to recombination hotspots, independently of mismatch recognition. This recruitment is essential to limit gene conversion tract lengths genome-wide, without affecting crossover formation. Contrary to expectations, Mer3 helicase activity, proposed to extend the displacement loop (D-loop) recombination intermediate, does not influence the length of gene conversion events, revealing non-catalytical roles of Mer3. In addition, both purified Mer3 and MutL{$\beta$} preferentially recognize D-loops, providing a mechanism for limiting gene conversion in vivo. These findings show that MutL{$\beta$} is an integral part of a new regulatory step of meiotic recombination, which has implications to prevent rapid allele fixation and hotspot erosion in populations.},

  abstract = {Sgs1, the budding yeast homolog of the mammalian BLM helicase, has been implicated in preventing excess recombination during both vegetative growth and meiosis. Most meiotic crossover (CO) recombination requires full function of a set of yeast proteins (Zip1, Zip2, Zip3, Zip4/Spo22, Mer3, Msh4, and Msh5, termed the SIC or ZMM proteins) that are also required for homologous chromosome synapsis. We report here genetic and molecular assays showing that sgs1 single mutants display relatively modest increases in CO recombination (less than 1.6-fold relative to wild-type). In contrast, a much greater CO increase is seen when an sgs1 mutation is introduced into the CO- and synapsis-deficient zip1, zip2, zip3, mer3, or msh4 mutants (2- to 8-fold increase). Furthermore, close juxtaposition of the axes of homologous chromosomes is restored. CO restoration in the mutants is not accompanied by significant changes in noncrossover (NCO) recombinant frequencies. These findings show that Sgs1 has potent meiotic anti-CO activity, which is normally antagonized by SIC/ZMM proteins. Our data reinforce previous proposals for an early separation of meiotic processes that form CO and NCO recombinants.},

Double strand breaks (DSBs), the initial changes of DNA in meiotic recombination, do not disappear completely and are hyperresected late in mer3 meiosis, indicating that MER3 is required for the transition of DSBs to later intermediates. A mer3 mutation reduces crossover frequencies, and the remaining crossovers show random distribution along a chromosome, resulting in a high incidence of non-disjunction of homologous chromosomes at the first meiotic division. MER3 appears to be very important for both the DSB transition and crossover control.},

The purified MER3 protein is a DNA helicase that translocates along single-stranded DNA in the 3{${'}$} to 5{${'}$} direction displacing annealed DNA fragments. Here, MER3 was found to be able to unwind various double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) substrates, including a 30-bp dsDNA with a 20-nucleotide 3{${'}$}-overhang, a 30-bp dsDNA with a 20-nucleotide 5{${'}$}-overhang, a 50-bp dsDNA with blunt ends, and a Holliday junction with 25-bp arms, each of which had a blunt end. Efficient unwinding of the 3{${'}$}-overhang substrate appeared to initiate by the binding of MER3 to the 3{${'}$} single-stranded tail in a reaction that required six or more unpaired bases. Unwinding of the blunt end and 5{${'}$}-overhang substrates appeared to initiate at the blunt ends of these substrates. Unwinding of the Holliday junction was more efficient than the unwinding of the blunt and 5{${'}$}-overhang substrates and was influenced by Mg2+ concentrations that cause changes in the structure of the junction. Possible roles for Holliday junction unwinding in meiotic crossover are discussed.},

In a mer3 deletion mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, crossing over is decreased, and the distribution of the crossovers that occur is random. The predicted Mer3 protein contains seven motifs characteristic of the DExH box type of DNA/RNA helicases. The mer3G166D and the mer3K167A mutation, amino acid substitutions of conserved residues in a putative nucleotide-binding domain of the helicase motifs caused a defect in the transition of meiosis-specific double-strand breaks to later intermediates, decreased crossing over, and reduced crossover interference. The purified Mer3 protein was found to have DNA helicase activity. This helicase activity was reduced by the mer3GD mutation to {$<$}1\% of the wild-type activity, even though binding of the mutant protein to single- and double-strand DNA was unaffected. The mer3KA mutation eliminated the ATPase activity of the wild-type protein. These results demonstrate that Mer3 is a DNA helicase that functions in meiotic crossing over.},

Immunostaining analysis indicated that CcMer3 was localized on chromosomes at zygotene and pachytene and CcMer3 foci were more frequent on paired than unpaired chromosomes. We generated a C. cinereus mer3 mutant (\#1) and found that it showed abnormal meiosis progression and underwent apoptosis after prophase I. Basidiospore production in \#1 was reduced to 0.8\% of the wild-type level; the spores showed slower germination at 25\textdegree{}C but were similar to the wild type at 37\textdegree{}C. Electron microscopic analysis of chromosome spreads revealed that axial elements were formed in the mutant but that synapsis was defective, resulting in a reduction in spore production. Our results demonstrate that CcMer3 is required for synaptonemal complex formation after axial elements align and is thus essential for homologous synapsis.},
