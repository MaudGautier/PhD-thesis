It is here attempted to ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations {$\sigma$}1 and {$\sigma$}2, it is found that the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard deviation . It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages of the total variance which they together produce. It is desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose phrases about the ``percentage of causation,'' which obscure the essential distinction between the individual and the population, should be carefully avoided.},

Since then, it has become a classic text in evolutionary biology, with Fisher hailed as one of the greatest evolutionary biologists of this century. This Variorum edition will be the definitive version - the only version of The Genetical Theory in print: it will include both Fisher's original 1930 text and that of a second edition of the book, published by Dover publications in 1958, which is now out of print. It also has a new Foreword, some unpublished material by Fisher that he wrote in his own copy, and letters between Fisher and Darwin's grandson, Leonard Darwin.

Whether codon usage is also generally shaped by natural selection in large organisms, despite their relatively small effective population size (Ne), is unclear. In animals, the population genetics of codon usage bias has only been studied in a handful of model organisms so far, and can be affected by confounding, nonadaptive processes such as GC-biased gene conversion and experimental artefacts. Using population transcriptomics data, we analyzed the relationship between codon usage, gene expression, allele frequency distribution, and recombination rate in 30 nonmodel species of animals, each from a different family, covering a wide range of effective population sizes. We disentangled the effects of translational selection and GC-biased gene conversion on codon usage by separately analyzing GC-conservative and GC-changing mutations. We report evidence for effective translational selection on codon usage in large-Ne species of animals, but not in small-Ne ones, in agreement with the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution. C- and T-ending codons tend to be preferred over synonymous G- and A-ending ones, for reasons that remain to be determined. In contrast, we uncovered a conspicuous effect of GC-biased gene conversion, which is widespread in animals and the main force determining the fate of AT{$\leftrightarrow$}GC mutations. Intriguingly, the strength of its effect was uncorrelated with Ne.},

In The Causes of Evolution he not only helped to marry the new science of genetics to the older one of evolutionary theory but also provided an accessible introduction to the genetical basis of evolution by natural selection. Egbert Leigh's new introduction to this classic work places it in the context of the ongoing study of evolution. Describing Haldane's refusal to be confined by a "System" as a "light-hearted" one, Leigh points out that we are now finding that "Haldane's questions are the appropriate next stage in learning how adaptation can evolve. We are now ready to reap the benefit of the fact that Haldane was a free man in the sense that really matters."},

In conjunction with diffusion models (the stochastic theory) of gene frequencies in finite populations, it treats these phenomena in quantitative terms based on actual observations. Although the theory has been strongly criticized by the `selectionists', supporting evidence has accumulated over the years. Particularly, the recent outburst of DNA sequence data lends strong support to the theory both with respect to evolutionary base substitutions and DNA polymorphism, including rapid evolutionary base substitutions in pseudogenes. In addition, the observed pattern of synonymous codon choice can now be readily explained in the framework of this theory. I review these recent findings in the light of the neutral theory.},

In the case of a neutral polymorphism, average heterozygosity will be reduced to an extent which varies with distance from the substituted locus. The aggregate effect of substitution on neutral polymorphism is estimated; in populations of total size 106 or more (and perhaps of 104 or more), this effect will be more important than that of random fixation. This may explain why the extent of polymorphism in natural populations does not vary as much as one would expect from a consideration of the equilibrium between mutation and random fixation in populations of different sizes. For a selectively maintained polymorphism at a linked locus, this process will only be important in the long run if it leads to complete fixation. If the selective coefficients at the linked locus are small compared to those at the substituted locus, it is shown that the probability of complete fixation at the linked locus is approximately exp (- Nc), where c is the recombinant fraction and N the population size. It follows that in a large population a selective substitution can occur in a cistron without eliminating a selectively maintained polymorphism in the same cistron.},

It is almost universally recognized that no other theory has had as vast an impact on biology as the theory of evolution, emphasizing as it does that no organic being can be fully understood except by considering its history. Whether we are dealing with structures, functions or habits, individually or in their interactions, their understanding is one-sided and partial without a consideration of the historic processes that brought them into being.
