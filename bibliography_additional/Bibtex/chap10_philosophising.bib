  abstract = {Between 1940 and 1970 pioneers in the new field of cell biology discovered the operative parts of cells and their contributions to cell life. They offered mechanistic accounts that explained cellular phenomena by identifying the relevant parts of cells, the biochemical operations they performed, and the way in which these parts and operations were organised to accomplish important functions. Cell biology was a revolutionary science but in this book it also provides fuel for yet another revolution, one that focuses on the very conception of science itself. Laws have traditionally been regarded as the primary vehicle of explanation, but in the emerging philosophy of science it is mechanisms that do the explanatory work. Bechtel emphasises how mechanisms were discovered, focusing especially on the way in which new instruments made these inquiries possible. He also describes how new journals and societies provided institutional structure to this new enterprise.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meiotic recombination ensures proper segregation of homologous chromosomes and creates genetic variation. In many organisms, recombination occurs at limited sites, termed 'hotspots', whose positions in mammals are determined by PR domain member 9 (PRDM9), a long-array zinc-finger and chromatin-modifier protein. Determining the rules governing the DNA binding of PRDM9 is a major issue in understanding how it functions.
RESULTS: Mouse PRDM9 protein variants bind to hotspot DNA sequences in a manner that is specific for both PRDM9 and DNA haplotypes, and that in vitro binding parallels its in vivo biological activity. Examining four hotspots, three activated by Prdm9Cst and one activated by Prdm9Dom2, we found that all binding sites required the full array of 11 or 12 contiguous fingers, depending on the allele, and that there was little sequence similarity between the binding sites of the three Prdm9Cst activated hotspots. The binding specificity of each position in the Hlx1 binding site, activated by Prdm9Cst, was tested by mutating each nucleotide to its three alternatives. The 31 positions along the binding site varied considerably in the ability of alternative bases to support binding, which also implicates a role for additional binding to the DNA phosphate backbone.
CONCLUSIONS: These results, which provide the first detailed mapping of PRDM9 binding to DNA and, to our knowledge, the most detailed analysis yet of DNA binding by a long zinc-finger array, make clear that the binding specificities of PRDM9, and possibly other long-array zinc-finger proteins, are unusually complex.},

The ``Modern Synthesis'' of evolutionary biology coalesced and revitalized evolutionary theory beginning in the 1930s. It stressed the explanatory power of natural selection and gradual change to account for the processes that govern natural populations today, as well as patterns in the history of life. In the past 40 years, the synthesis has been challenged on various fronts ranging from paleontology to developmental biology, systematics, biogeography, and molecular and developmental biology. Several of its central propositions have been modified and expanded as a result. How well the synthesis continues to be effective will depend on its continued ability to test its central propositions and the efficacy of its central mechanisms, particularly on the basis of new evidence from emerging fields of study.},

F1 sperm assays indicate that within this ``torrid zone'' the most active hotspot (A3) can initiate recombination on H and SPRET but not B6 chromosomes. The A3 DNA sequence contains a (G/C)TTT repeat, long stretches of A or T, and a cyclic variation in AT content. Recombination was drastically reduced in a cross between B6 and a B6.SPRET Ath1 congenic strain, but was unaffected in a B6 \texttimes{} B6.H Ath1 congenic cross. Similar nonrandom clustering of hotspots has been observed in yeast and the major histocompatibility complexes of human and mouse. To the extent that torrid zones are a general feature of mammalian genomes, they have considerable implications for genetic mapping strategies in both human populations and mouse crosses.},

  abstract = {A good book may have the power to change the way we see the world, but a great book actually becomes part of our daily consciousness, pervading our thinking to the point that we take it for granted, and we forget how provocative and challenging its ideas once were\textemdash{}and still are. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach.  With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don't arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of ``normal science,'' as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age.  This new edition of Kuhn's essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn's ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking's introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science.},

It would seem altogether fitting that this year's symposium be devoted to a consideration of the evolutionary theory. We are celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species and the occasion of such a centenary is the proper moment to review the past and consider the future. It is almost universally recognized that no other theory has had as vast an impact on biology as the theory of evolution, emphasizing as it does that no organic being can be fully understood except by considering its history. Whether we are dealing with structures, functions or habits, individually or in their interactions, their understanding is one-sided and partial without a consideration of the historic processes that brought them into being.
The history of the first one hundred years since the publication of the Origin of Species is a fascinating one. With its many controversies, its false starts...},

  abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black
boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite
important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action
based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such
understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to
transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this
work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the
predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by
learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose
a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions
and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular
optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by
explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image
classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via
novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios
that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between
models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier
should not be trusted.},

Philosophy is the attempt to answer such ultimate questions, not carelessly and dogmatically, as we might deal with them in ordinary life, but critically, after analysing how and why the questions arise and clarifying the assumptions and concepts on which they are based. This classic work, first published in 1912, has never been supplanted as an approachable introduction to the theory of philosophical enquiry. It gives Russell's views on such subjects as the distinction between appearance and reality, the existence and nature of matter, idealism, knowledge by acquaintance and by description, induction, and the limits and value of philosophical knowledge. This edition includes an introduction by John Skorupski contextualizing Russell's work, and a guide to further reading.},

  abstract = {Recombination within the MHC does not occur at random, but crossovers are clustered in hot spots. We previously described a recombinational hotspot within the 50-kb Hsp70.3-G7 interval in the class III region of the mouse MHC. The parental haplotypes of recombinants with crossovers in this region represent the majority of the laboratory haplotypes (a, b, d, dx, k, m, p, px, q, s, and u). Using microsatellite markers and sequence-based nucleotide polymorphisms, the breakpoint intervals of 30 recombinants were mapped to a 5-kb-long interval within the G7c gene adjacent to G7a. Recombination within the G7c hot spot does not appear to be restricted to certain haplotypes. Sequence motifs that had been suggested to be associated with site-restricted meiotic recombination were absent in the vicinity of the G7c hot spot, and hence, these sequence motifs are no prerequisite for meiotic recombination. The G7c hot spot resides in a region to which a number of disease susceptibility loci have been mapped, including susceptibility to cleft palate, experimental autoimmune allergic orchitis, and chemically induced alveolar lung tumors. The exact localization of crossovers in recombinants that have been used in functional studies is important for mapping susceptibility genes and limits the number of candidate genes.},

Using recombinant inbred strains as a CO library, here we report the identification and detailed characterization of seven new meiotic hot spots on mouse chromosome 19, more than doubling the number of currently available mouse hot spots. Although a shared feature is the narrow 1.5\textendash{}2.5-kb width of these recombinogenic sites, these analyses revealed that hot spots have diverse sequence attributes and distinct symmetric and asymmetric CO profiles. Interestingly, CO molecules with discontinuous conversion tracts are commonly observed, contrasting with those found in human. Furthermore, unlike human hot spots, those present in the mouse do not necessarily have a quasi-normal CO distribution but harbor CO repulsion zones within recombinogenic cores. We propose a model where local chromatin landscape directs these repulsion zones.},
